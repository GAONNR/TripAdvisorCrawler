My favorite spot in Seoul
This is defiantly my favorite spot in Seoul, I remember that I visited it in my second day there and I was amazed by its beauty, the beauty of the trees, the beauty of families, the beauty of weather.It was far from my hostel but I kept dreaming for visiting it again during my trip, I didn't do but I'll absolutely come back one day.
Olympic 1988 reminder
In 1988, Seoul held the summer Olympics and the Olympic Park was built for these games. The Olympic Park is a huge park and it is a joy to be in it. I found it to be a beautiful park. The park is divided into four zones namely for sports/recreation; arts and culture; environment; and history. The park has a walking trail along an ancient fortress. The arts and cultural part of the park has the SOMA Museum of Art. In the sculpture park, there are over 200 sculptures by different domestic and international artists. Apparently, the Olympic Park is one of the five top sculpture parks in the world. There are a number of sporting events that still take place for example the velodrome hosts cycling events. The Olympic Hall is now used for concerts. Well known artists like Mariah Carey have performed here.As you walk to the Peace Gate, there is a nice lake where you can see many different kinds of birds. The Peace Gate celebrates peace and harmony.There is also an Olympic Museum which houses many items relating to the Seoul Olympics and also other Olympics.
Green lung
Very fortunate to visit during local historic festival and a music Festival. Although a very busy space enjoyed by locals I never felt claustrophobic, with some wonderful sites and landscaping. The local community obviously rely on the space to interact and embrace their neighbours and many local clubs meet here. A really pleasant environment to spend an afternoon or evening doing nothing
Family/ Couple Friendly Park for a day out
This park is BEAUTIFUL! I went there on a sunny day, and there were a lot of elderlies came a long as well. Since I went on a Sunday, the park was full of families and couples who came for picnic. Also, it has bike rental for the public so that people can bike around the park rather than walking since it's a quite huge park. There are some peaks that people can actually hike and enjoy the view of the Olympic Park from the top. There are some museums and different stadiums in the park that people can visit if they are interested. Highly recommended for family, friends or couple outing.
Nice Nod to Seoul's Olympic History
This is within walking distance from Lotte World. If you don't see the Olympic monument when you first arrive it is because it is on the other end of the park. I wish there was a statue of Hodori the 1988 Olympic mascot.
Place of memories
This is a place where opening ceremonies were organized in 1988. Beautiful park with some cafes, ponds, walking routes, museums... If you want memories the games there is a wall which tells the Olympic game winners. Children can rent bicycle vehicles.
MUST SEE.
This was a wondeful experience. Absolute must see. The Olympic shrines, the stadiums and the eternal flame. Also some beautiful nature here too. Right by the metro station. No excuses you must check it out. Not really a busy place so pjehty of space to walk and take pictures.I combined it with Lotte mall as it was about 1.5 km away so a simple walk 
Quiet and peaceful park
This park has lovely paths with shelter under trees. It is busy in places but it is soon easy to get away from them.This is a large area comprising lakes, paths and the remnants of the 1988 Olympics. The gold medal winners and many other important details of the Olympics are engraved in a large memorial in front of a big lake. However, many of the facilities are no more or are used for other purposes.
Beautiful park
This park is my favourite so far it's so beautiful the hills to walk in and the facilities the lake view is amazing eminded me of London parks.you will find some beautiful arts work as well and there's a kids playground, cafes and grocery shop. A perfect park 
September Festival
Hi, I had a great time at Olympic Part last year. If you come to Korea in September, I am glad to introduce a great Korean traditional festival in Seoul in September. There will be a lot of things to see and experience, and you will get to know the Korean history enjoying the festival. It is HangSeong Baekje Cultural Festival! - When : Sep 21 ~ Sep 24, 2017 - Where : Olympic Park, Seoul, Korea - Theme of the Festival : Meet the King of Baekje in Seoul of 2,000 years agoThe Songpa area in Seoul was the ancient capital of the Baekje Kingdom for 500 years during the Hanseong Baekje Era (18 BC-AD 475) around 2,000 years ago. Songpa is also home to a number of time-honored historic and cultural heritage sites, including Pungnaptoseong Fortress and Mongchontoseong Fortress. The festival offers visitors a glimpse into the ancient history and culture of the Hanseong Baekje Period that brilliantly flourished based on a strong national power. You will enjoy the beautiful weather of fall in Seoul and feel the breath of Korean ancient dynasty, Baekje.
Visiting history
A nice visit to see the main olympic area when Seoul hosted the olympics. Lots of history and information about the Olympics and the winners. A nice time to spend half a day. Close to Lotte World, so a good idea to combine both.
Olympic Park Shines
This park is a MUST SEE for any tourist. The sculptures are beautiful and offer a huge variety to satisfy everyone's artistic tastes. The grounds are lovely and well-maintained. I didn't get to see the museums as they weren't open on a Monday but if the rest of the site is anything to go by, I'm sure they are great too! Awesome place!!!
A nice experience if you have the time
The park is a bit out of the way, I remember it taking us quite a while to get here from Hongdae. However, because of this it's a quiet place for a nice stroll or bike ride away from the hustle and bustle of Seoul. You can see a lot of the locals utilizing this place and it's nice use of land built for the olympics previously as you hear in the news that more recent venues are completely unused or abandoned. I would recommend biking around the area since it's quite large too.
Festival!
I had seen the poster for the jazz festival in this park. When we saw the huge crowd, we were extremely happy.It is a peaceful place to relax. Trash receptacles were placed throughout the park. So, we can enjoy festivals!!!!!!!!!
A Great Morning in the Park
We are visiting Seoul for the first time and although we are trying many of the typical tourist attractions, the Seoul Olympic Park has turned out to be one of our favorite places to visit. It is off the beaten path and provides a quiet green oasis in urban Seoul. The imposing entrance at the World Peace Gate is not to be missed, especially at night when kids and parents fill the plaza with bikes and kites and energy. The small lake is a nice spot to watch birds is the morning as well as an array of citizens exercising. The hiking paths are plentiful and it is pleasant to hike along with Seoul seniors out for a morning walk.If you want to get away from the hustle and bustle and mingle with the local crowd, it is a great location. It shows the positive uses that can be made of former Olympic venues.
Famous symbol
Worth it just for the World Peace symbol which was the logo for the 88 Games. It is a huge structure dominating the plaza, the shape of which up close was different to what I had seen and remembered.Thanks for the vote if you found this review helpful.
Good place
Olympic park , one of the national places now reminding us the Olympic held in seoul and all the grounds .
Fun to see and walk around, but not much here, just a walk through
We walked through the park on our way to the Lotte Mall and observation tower. It was fun to see but not a ton to see, an easy walk through on your way to other things. 
The Park with everything
I lived a walk away from Olympic Park for a year and a half. It has everything you could want for recreational variety and spending almost nothing. It is a beautiful expansive park where you can rent bikes, Jarveys and eat and drink from many vendors. There are lots of free sports facilities and there are lots of state of the art facilities. The Olyoic facilities have been maintained well amd are used also. There are cafes and stores at many of the entrances. I attended some great concerts there and the Davis cup was held there in 2015. Each entrance offers a different experience and each exit has a subway or a local neighbourhood to explore. One of my great loves of Seoul was exploring it and this Park sits very near the top.
Most enjoyable
Very impressed layout. The amazing sculptures are worth visiting. The lake and its surrounds very photogenic. 
Excellent public space
This place wasn't on our agenda to visit but since we had some extra free time we decided to do give it a look-see. Absolutely no regrets. The 1988 olympic site is now an excellent public space so we see a lot of Koreans come here to unwind or to take a lunch break. We entered via the front going through the expansive Peace Square plaza and along the boulevards lined by pillar masks made by sculptor Seung-Taek Lee that leads to the World Peace Gate and the eternal flame. We hired a tandem bike so we could quickly get an overview of the park and then decide which spots we would like to cover in greater depth. The Flag plaza is still flying the flags of the participating countries. Incorporated in the park are the "themed parks" - the cultural art park with more than 200 (many captivating) sculptures scattered throughout its sprawling lawns along with the Olympic Musem and the SOMA (Seoul Olympics Museum of Art), the leisure sports park - obviously, the environmental eco-park with flora and fauna that excites and lastly the history experience park featuring the historical fortress and museum about the Baekju period. Once can easily spend half a day or more here. Definitely worth the visit.
Large park for a good walk
The Olympic Park is not far from the city centre and is readily accessible via the metro. The most striking part is the large concrete structure at the entrance. I went there in early April and the magnolia flowers were flourishing. The rest of the park seemed to be quite mundane. It is a very large park, good for a long walk.
A lot of thought in the design...
...obviously, given why it was created. Well laid out with plenty of artwork for photo opportunities. Stadiums (stadia) are quite impressive. Nice for a couple of hours walk - can hire a bike too.
Great piece of history
It was great to see the location of the 1984 olympics. We walked through the entire park and is well worth a visit.
Great architecture and landscaping 
This park is great. It is huge and the sculptures are unique and interesting. The park was busy with families playing with young children and riding bikes. Many people walking and running around the area. The place is well kept and I am glad that I came to explore 
Nice walk
Beautiflu park, worth visitng and walking around. The view of water, grass, flowers, everything is well preserved. The flags square and fire is cool if you are interested in that sort of stuff.
Worth a visit!
Being Olympic fans, we loved this area. We could picture people milling about heading to events. The Olympic Museum has free admittance and is worth a visit! Information is about all athletes, not just the Korean athletes. The entrance gate to the area is spectacular!
Good place for fun activities and relaxation
Great park, with food, sports, and bicycle (2-seater, 4-seaters) riding opportunities. Fun place to relax take pictures, play games, and have a picnic. I suggest it as a must see.
Big greening area in the city
The park is big so at least you have to spend a whole day if you want to tour around the whole park. There are a lot of statue in the park, in addition it has museum of art, large greening area. It is suitable for leisure, jogging, biking and picnic etc.,There are many cafe and restaurants inside the park, you can take a break there when you feel tired. The price are reasonable.I strongly advised not to visit there in winter because no tree or plant blossoms. I visited there on 19 March 2017. It was a sunny day, I found very comfortable there, the air was fresh and the park was spacious. At that day, I did not see many tourists, most of the visitors were Korean.
If you love the Olympics this is a must visit
As a huge, life-long Olympics fan I thoroughly enjoyed my visit here. The building and grounds are very well maintained and the signs are very clear to navigate the area. The monuments are fantastic to browse and give a great history of the Olympics and all the Korean medal winners. The highlight for me was the Jamsil Baseball Stadium. I hope to be back sometime again to actually see a game played!
Landmark!
The Admission: FREE AdmissionThe Park: This park is located in the center of Seoul and built for 1988 Olympics. There are over 200 sculptures on the lawn. Popular movie and TV commercial filming location. This place also has venue for concerts and sports event. There are museums and art galleries in the park too. The Location: Subway Line 5, Olympic Park Station. Exit 3
Good park in the East Seoul
This park has many large grassplots to enjoy picnic. Please check some festival in this park if any - for example, Seoul Jazz Festival annualy.
Giant, beautiful park to enjoy for free with friends and family
There is so much to do and see at this beautiful park! My husband and I spent an afternoon walking around, enjoying the Olympic theme, outdoor sculptures, street food vendors, and entertainment options. It is a huge park with lots of open space and can accommodate large crowds easily. We rented bicycles while we were there and we noticed visitors could also rent scooters and pedal-driven coaches with built-in canopies for shade. You could also bring a picnic lunch and chairs to enjoy the several lawn areas. During our visit, we also toured the Olympic-themed museum on the property. 
Temporary ice skating playground is open!
From time to time, I go to the park. This time, I found a nice temporary ice skating ground where all the kids are skating! Some of lovely couples are also enjoying their leisure time with love ones. It is extremely good price, admission is 2,000KRW(1.7 USD) and rental is 1,000KRW(80 cents) per 1 and 20 min session. There are intermission between sessions, this ticket allows only one session. Anyway it is just less than3 USD, kids can enjoy skating. There were lots of teenagers, couples, and parents who were watching & coaching their kids, That ground reminded me of my childhood when I skated on the wild field or on the Han River...Those times, the Han River used to be frozen... well, this skating place is seasonal and temporary for couple of months. I think it is better to go during weekdays than weekends, which is quite crowded. Even if the weather was quite cold, nobody cares about that because of fun!
great place to visit
Will go to Olympic Park once I travel to Seoul, I have been there in spring, summer, autumn and winter. It is suitable for everyone in any season to visit. It definitely a good place to relax and unwind.
Lovely Park with lots of interesting views to see
It so happened that a music festival was on-going when my husband and I visited. We did not get tickets because we werent sure who were playing and most of them were local / Korean bands. There were so many people around the area but we were not frustrated as the whole place was just lovely! We enjoyed sitting on the lake whilst listening to the sound of the bands playing. It was so memorable and we thought if we ever go back to Seoul, we would not miss the chance to visit Olympic Park again.
Fantastic for phographers in the morning
Great walk around the ancient fort in the middle of the pak, just after the main gate turn up the stairs on the left, the walk carries you around a scenic tour for 2 km. Great experience!
My favorite place in Seoul
Whenever you visit here, you can enjoy beautiful scenery. The park was arranged and built with ancient historical sites about 30 years ago. You can see the harmony of the old sites and the sculptures which human made. Also goof place for trail; walking and running. 
not elderly and disabled friendly
I have a small disability.Do not be misled that you can take the subway.After you disembark, you need walk a long way.you walk along a huge car park ( Olympic Park South Gate carpark ) and reach a cafe, the brand is starbucks or coffeebean. And the long walk continues. If you are tourist, you would feel lost. Are you here to see the many sports centres, like velodrome, tennis, swimming?They are all separate. In the past, the Gov provided some sort of " tour bus" free of charge ; it went round the park but today I visited the website, this service is not mentioned anymore. Last year I was there on a weekday, the sports centres were closed.The Velodrome was closed. We walked around, wondering how to access.There were some Koreans going in and out of an office in the velodrome building but they would not help. They were very unfriendly. Later, we found a little gate and we went through that , to see the interior of the velodrome for a few minutes. After that it was a long walk back to the main road. The terrain is not elderly or handicap friendly.
Prada of Flowers
Parade of beautiful flowers await you at Olympic Park. Easy reachable by subway and just a short walk from the subway station. We visited late in the season, October, so the peak season was past, however the Roses and Cosmos’ were beautiful. Also enjoyed visiting with school children on a school outing. If you love flowers this is the place for a convenient visit. As Korean aspiring athletes train here you may have an opportunity to view a practice. We enjoyed watching tennis players sharping their skills. A great afternoon.
very nice park for cycling and relaxing
I remember the games in 1988 and how I was allowed to stay up late to watch the epic, but ultimately the complete let down of the 100 meter final. From that day on I wanted to visit Seoul and the Olympic park, this year I finally got to go. With my memories firmly embedded in my mind I set off walking around this magnificent park, viewing the sculptures that each visiting team had left and the still used facilities. We took a bike and rode around for an hour before coming to a stop at one of the many coffee shops available.the Olympic park is a stunning place that brought the world together for the first time in 12yrs, worth a visit and so easy to get to.
destination in autumn.
Olympic park is located in the city. with the subway, exit 3 of Olympic Park Station, and you can see the monument of Olympic Park. but thats not the highlight, you need to walk behind the monument. there is a big lake and a beautiful road between trees. its really good to walk in the afternoon..
Take in a Ball Game
We got to see a professional baseball game here. If you get the chance to be there during baseball season, take the family. My suggestions - definitely sit in the cheering section (if you can get a ticket) and HAVE FUN. Lots of food options for the whole family or just you two. Will do this again
Trip down history lane!
Although the day was cloudy, we took the bike ride around the pathways and gardens while looking at the facilities from 1988 Olympics. Some buildings were very tired and locked to the public; others had been turned into day care centers however the gardens, statues and memories were terrific. The gardens were turning with the autumn colours and many flowers were still out. Pretty great all round - well worth the couple of hours.
Glorious autumn leaves walk!
Oh this was one of our most favorite days in Seoul. The park was big, beautiful and so well maintained. We went through the main entrance first because the street beside it is famous for the beautiful rows of yellow leave trees (forgotten their names!) but the park itself is just as stunning! Very peaceful, great for a stroll and picnic. The small speakers around the park even had classical music playing out of it which was a cute touch. LOVED this place!
Great place to walk
This Olympic park has been kept in great condition and is still a wonderful place to walk around on a nice day. There are plenty of different areas as the park is so big. There are several sports facilities still on the site, as well as bike hire. The Olympic spirit lives on too, with plenty of reminders of the games including some sculptures, the giant arch way, the flagpoles and the stones donated by each nation which took part. Some countries who no longer exist are still there too which is nice for nostalgia seekers. This was the last Olympic games for a lot of nations. 
Fun, and lots of open space
This was a fun surprise after a long metro ride. I spent three hours here, and still didn't see everything on my list. There are lots of fun (modern art) sculptures scattered on the grounds of the 1988 Olympic grounds. Not sure if the venues are open, I didn't go inside any except the museum which was wonderful. This is a fun activity after you have seen one too many ancient gates and temples. Fresh air, beautiful grounds, and even a kiddie train to ride for 1200 Wan. 
Nice scenery
This olympic park has a nice view. You can rent a bike to go around the and see so many beautiful scenery as you paddle.
Lovely grounds and unusual pieces of art
We hired a family bike to go round.we thought an hour would be too long,but we could have done with a bit more.had great fun cycling around all the halls that were used for all the different sports.Had lunch in a great buffet restaurant where we tried a lot of local food.It was very reasonable,the only thing,it wasn't on English so you didn't always know what you were eating
Nice but nothing more
Its great that Seoul has gotten use of their olympic park. Its a nice area where you get to see some historical thing along with the old stadiums. But its doesnt give a lot more than that. Plan a shorter trip here. You might be lucky and be in Seoul when they arrange events in the park.
Lovely park
We took the metro here which was convenient and easy to locate. On the day we came there was an exhibition or festival with activities going on as there were lots of tents with segways, tennis and bmx around. We watched a motorbike show with a few bikes doing stunts. The park was quite busy with school aged children around cycling, people having a walk and taking their children to the playground. The Olympic flame is still going and there is a museum which is free which was worth a pop in although there was potential to be much better and informative. We hired a 4 wheel bike for 1,000 won for 60 mins which was fun to go around searching for the various stadiums to save on a lot of steps and time. The park is a great place to get away from the hustle and bustle of it all and whiled away a couple of hours for us. 
Nothing special
This park is nothing special. It may have been nice back in 1988 when the Olympics were in Korea. However there's not much to see here now. No tourists go there. Only locals walk around here.
Wonderful place to take a walk!
Huge place! Lots of families with kids. Coffee shops, resto, and small stores at the gate. Lovely trees and grass. On my way to swimming pool, (for half day admission 6,000 KRW, =about 6 USD, you can choose morning session or afternoon session), I could enjoy my walk from the station to the pool. Since this pool was used for the 1988 Olympic Games, quite fun to see the pool. If I had more energy, I wanted to take a seat and read a book under the nice weather. Entering grass is not allowed for the winter, as far as I know.
Be ready for lots of walking
I think a bike would be best to explore this place. They are allowed everywhere, and you would save a lot of steps. We only spent about an hour, but could go inside many of the buildings, such as the gymnastics arena, the indoor pool, etc. wish we could have found a gift shop. Lots of great Statues here. The acupressure path lets you walk on a walkway made of many types of stones, wooden beams, etc. that excercise parts of your feet. Print a map before you go, you'll be glad you did, if speaking English. Lots of drink vending machines along paths, and public restrooms are clean, free.
Great Park
Sept-2016) My son and enjoyed the olympic park. The train from hongik took a while, alot of walking for young children, but we enjoyed the olympic museum and "Baejke Museum" (next to the sculpture park)..both were free! We did not makevitto the SOMA museum or the olympic venues as would have been to much walking for my 8yr old. 
Great way to spend a morning strolling the gardens
Husband and I ventured 3 subway lines to Olympic park station. Take exit 3 and loose yourself in the grounds. Originally opened in 1986 for the Asia games and then the 88 Olympic Games it has held together better than some other countries. You can hire bicycles which we saw many do or else foot power like us is fine as well. Easy paths and clear directions. 
Nice memories
Seoul Olympic Park is huge! Would be nice to travel back to 1988 for the Olympics. Perfect for people who like to walk and have a good time.
Truly symbolic
Had visited here during night time. Well maintained. Enthusiasts do cycling, skating. I preferred to just walk down & enjoy. 
Nice park
The Olympic Park has some nice green areas and still quite a lot of the old Olympic stadiums. It was fun walking around with the current Olympics going on in Rio. 
Small size Central Park in the east of Seoul City.
Easy to approach from all different parts of Seoul City.Delicious food restaurants and shopping malls around.Good for stroll around the Park that takes only an hour+. 
Treasure hunt made it fun
They have 8 treasure hunts for you to find and stamp. This made it fun to walk around Olympic Park during the summer. Lots of art in the park also.
A cluster of interesting sights + hidden water mill!
I arrived at the East Gate and was a bit surprised to see promotion for a concert series going on in one of the establishments. Walking for a bit I started to also see the several interesting and somewhat curious sculptures along with a map of the grounds. IF you just want to see the World Peace Gate then go to the West Gate and you are good. If you however want a wonderful walk alongside with interesting sights on your way - the East Gate is a good point. Along with the statues you can enjoy a peaceful walk with the locals going about their everyday activities. The closer I got to the West Gate I found, tucked away cutely, a wonderful small water mill and simply continued discovering the grounds. The World Peace Gate is naturally an interesting sight, but the park as total is what I recommend.
Walking paradise for young and old
Plenty to see and do whilst unwinding from the bustle of the city.Hire bikes, stretch the legs, take in the views and get some fresh air away from the traffic fumes. Food and drink outlets are plentiful as are toilet facilities.The antidote to Myeongdong, Gangnam, Itaewon and all central districts.
Wonderful ride n View with Kids
Enjoy a relaxing 4 seaters cycle ride around the park with my kids. See beautiful scrupltures and lots of greeneries. A place to capture wonderful pictures.
Go to see the World Peace Gate and other structures around it.
The park is conveniently located near the Olympic Park Station on Line 5 of the Seoul Subway system or Mongchontoseong Station on Line 8. I got off at the Olympic Park Station but would actually recommend going to the Mongchontoseong Station since it's near the World Peace Gate. That and several structures around it (place with all the flags) are the best photo opportunities. It's basically a HUGE park, which isn't bad if you just want to relax and enjoy the scenery or get some exercise. If you so choose, there are actually fitness machines that you can use at the park.
Just a park
It's a great park for a walk in the middle of the city, but not much more, Not many signs in English here, so I had some problems getting around or knowing what it was. On the positive side, it was surprisingly quiet and I was there on a Saturday in the summer. I had a long walk in a scenic place, but not much to do with the olympics. Some stadiums and other buildings are still in the area and there's a museum. It was a beautiful day, so I did not feel like spending the day inside and had a wonderful walk in the park. Plenty of paths and bike-paths. You can rent a bike there as well.
A nice walk area
We took a walk around the park to have a look, and there are some good places to take a break and enjoy the view. We picked the lonely tree and also at one of the main fountains. You can rent trolleys and bikes at the entrance of the park where the diffrent halls are located.
Meh...
We drove and walked all over...never did find the Olympic Rings. :( There isn't much to see other than the feeling of being in the former Olympic village. That was cool.
Just because I love the Olympics
There wasn’t much to do but then again it is still the Olympic Park of the 1988 games. The Olympic flame is still there and so are museums. If you don’t get a bike, be prepared to walk. It is a bit run down now but so are many of the 2008 Olympic sites in Beijing and that occurred 20 years later. What we liked the most, and I am a big guy and love food is at night, they have a gathering of vendors and they bring together food from around the world. It was an enjoyable evening and I was able to taste food from around the world.
A nice place to exercise
This park is huge. It offers a good and free museum about the Baekje Kingdom, including a historical fortress wall walking trail (the wall itself is long gone). There are also interesting outdoor sculptures in the park and the park is part of a recommended hiking trail (which I didn't try) that goes on for several kilometers.
Beautiful, but tthere's not much to do
It's a nice park with beautiful structures and sceneries. There might be one or two museums nearby which you can visit. There are bike rentals too, and I think this might be the most exciting thing you can do. But overall, you wouldn't be able to do much in Olympic Park and the surrounding area. Good for a quick visit and photos but not for anything else.
Relive the glory days of 1988
Great location for many activities. Soccer, baseball, gymnastics and road racing. Olympic fans is a must visit
bigbang at olympic park
I came here to see BigBang's concert in march 2016. This place is nice to walk around and take photos. There were street food vendors so you don't need to worry about going hungry. For some odd reason I did not see any taxi stand and it was hard to catch a taxi since the road was gated off at the main entrance. My other mistake was taking a taxi here to the concert at 6pm. It was a total disaster. Taking the subway would've been easier and faster during rush hour.
Well designed park
I was travelling with a sports enthusiast thus we had to visit the Olympic Park. The admission is free and there is a long path with modern art sculpture. If you want to go to the Olympic Museum avoid SOMA (Seoul Olympic Museum of Art) as it has nothing to do with olympics and costs 3,000₩ - wasted money.
Place where to rest in the busy city
Good for walk, peaceful, quite quiet place. But don't expect too much, it's just a park, not even an extraordinary one. You can rent a double bike buggy there, too bad we found that out when already leaving, otherwise we would definitely go for it.
walk
Been there three times for a walk. Don't expect much from this park. They said they were supposed to have a roller skate area but when i came there it was completely empty and the staff just kicked me out.
we missed the spring flowers, but enjoyed our buggy ride!
definitely worth going to, but wait until the spring flowers are blooming or summertime. we rented a double bike buggy and that was a fun way to see the park. 
great place to people watch, bike around, and read in the grass
great place to people watch, bike around, and read in the grass with friends on a blanket. little spots to get food as well.
Home of the Korea National Sports University
Impressive place, well preserved and regularly used by locals, who easily mingle with the large body of students and staff from the Korea National Sports University. I gave a lecture there and was extremely well received. It's a very peaceful place in the middle of Seoul, which comes as a very pleasant surprise. 
Olympic!
Was able to see the peace gate only so I can't really what this olympic park has for visitors! But the peace gate was stunning!
Nice park for walk or a jog
Olympic park is a very nice place to enjoy a relaxed walk or to go on a jog. Many locals also work out in the park on any of the many gym-like facilities available. Besides the nature one can also enjoy architecture of the stadiums that were build for the olympics in Seoul or visit one of the museums. It is also possible to rent bikes to tour the park. I went in winter and i think that the park will be a lot greener on summer, making it even more enjoyable!
Opening ceremony
The Gymnastics arena was interesting to see as I've never been to an Olympic arena before. The show was excellent. 
Art and sport: winning combination
Despite visiting in winter, the park is well used by families and sports fans. The sculpture park has some extraordinary works in it: some inexplicable and others thought-provoking.
Large Park
This is a great park where you can rent bikes, tandem, or carts you peddle. There's a statue garden area that is interesting, lakes, and lots of room. There's nothing here that is must see unless you really like the Olympic areas. There's two subway stations that will take you here. I went to the wrong one to meet people and it takes about 35 minutes to walk to the other end.
Nice
Very clean and when we went, early morning, almost empty.It was quit vast and you needed to walk a lot to see everything.
Nice place to visit
This is not a bad place to drop by with the kids and family and have a grand day out! I highly recommend going on a weekday however to avoid a mass crowd of people though, but overall, its nice, spacious, and good for the kids to run around and have fun. Unfortunately they don't have kid play structures or something, but its not a bad place to take a bike or roller-blades around. 
Outdoor Ice Skating
My family really enjoyed the Outdoor Ice Skating.We went on a weekday afternoon, which mean less crowded. It only cost 2000Won per person inclusive of skating shoes & helmet for a good 1 1/2 hrs. Reservation is by block of time.Surrounding area is very scenic,too. There are activities for family cycling, which looks interesting, but, we missed it as it was turning dark by the time we are done with ice skating at about 5pm.There is also the Olympic museum within 2 minutes walk towards the left side from the main entrance. Entrance is free. Last entrance is 5:30pm.Travelling tips : Get off at Mongchontoseong station(Line 8) and take exit 1. You will see the Olympic Arc straight on. The ice rink is located at Peace Plaza inside the park.
A stroll through the park - a history of sports in Korea
I took one full day to walk through the Olympic Park (Infinity was slated to have their concert there and everywhere had their posters hang), then through to Seoul Baekje Museum which is located within the Park (very comfy place to visit and I even found a reading area where I promptly fell asleep). I finished my tour at the Park at Seoul Olympic Museum where a variety of sports history was showcased, including the national sport of Taekwondo. There is also a Starbucks outlet there at the Park near the walkway leading from the Subway station. 
Park with lots to do
We walked through the park and found tons of stuff to do. We even saw a wedding photo shoot taking place! There are biking areas, hiking areas and food/shopping. It's wonderful. Like everything in Korea, there could be more trash cans.
Nice way to spend a couple of hours...
This is a nice walk (or you can rent bicycles). It is a nice park. Nice sculptures and places to eat. Not a really big deal beyond that. it has a lot of history since this is where the 1988 summer games were held, but you can't get into any of the buildings so there is really nothing to do. You walk around and look at the big stadiums. If you love a walk in the park, this is for you. If you are looking to explore the Olympic complexes, that's not happening.
A breath of fresh air
If you decide to visit this place... make sure you are wearing your most comfortable shoes... walking is the name of the game... 
biggest reason Songpa is a good place to live
the park is huge and it's very well managed. always a joy to visit. real estate prices around the park have A LOT to do with this place. the coffee shop on the edge is pretty nice.
Good place to take a walk
One of the must-see attractions at the park are the outdoor sculptures (including those at the SOMA Museum of Art) comprising more than 200 pieces from world-famous and rising artists.
Worth visiting
I'd recommend a full day here, as the park is big and there's so much to see! On Saturdays lots of things are happening - gatherings, picnics, aerobic sessions - it's a lively place.
Rainy olympics
Beautiful park. Even while it was raining. Definately worth a trip. The old stadiums are still being used, apparently for concerts mostly. There is one construction site in the Park, but it still offers a lot of nice views. If you take the subway to get there you'll exit on a huge square where they still keep the Olympic fire burning.
Must visit
Asked to visit the Olympic Park during a recent business trip to Korea, well worth the time out of our day to see such a historic location
Perfect for jogging
While I was staying in Seoul I use to walk/job at Olympic Park. really nice. Lots of paths, ups and downs.It's overall a very nice place to visit and walk.
Cycling Day
Its a huge park and bicycle can be rented for you to navigate around the park.Landmarks such as the Olympic Fire, Tower etc. are good photo-taking icons.
sport in olympic park
nice spot for sport in morning and evening, many children practice in here and we can taking photo in here
A memento from the 1988 Games
It is vast and close to the Jamsil district. Use line 8 on the underground and get out at Mongchontoseong station.Built for the 1988 Olympic Games, still has a flame and all of the flags are up too. The park, skillfully landscaped and complete with lakes, waterfalls and modern sculptures, can be explored on double bikes or 4 biker-seats and hired by the hour for a reasonable price. In the space of one hour, you can go round and see most of it on one of these contraptions whilst taking photos too. I would recommend - fun and enjoyable.
Great spot for a family day trip
Olympic Park is an awesome experience for anyone who enjoys strolling for hours. This park is filled with probably hundreds of sculptures and other permanent artwork to view and photograph...some more interesting than others. There are 2 spots to rent bikes if walking doesn't sound appealing. The main entrance is pretty awe inspiring. The eternal flame burns strong underneath the permanent canopy, with the pavilion opening up to the participant country flags backdropped by an amazing pond with shooting water jet fountains. Photo opportunities abound.
Nice place to see modern seoul history
The olympic park is a nice way to see the olympic legacy of the Seoul Olympics. There is an athlete walkway and an Olympic museum
Great park
Very nice park, impressive the Peace Gate, pretty much still enjoyed by locals and tourists alike. Wotrh visiting, definitely.
Great place for couples.
It is a really nice place where is so clean and warm , you can see many couples,old men or women,childern and dogs.Walking is a best activity there,although you can go hiking.Hope you can visit there with your lover.
The 1988 Olympic Park
When you walk out of the metro station the first thing you see is the massive beautiful Olympic Gate. The park is very clean.
The Peace Gate is very impressive
There's lot of acreage and many different stadiums, museums and walkways. It's certainly worth a visit, especially if there is a good exhibit at the SOMA museum. Be prepared for a lot of walking. The Peace Gate is near Exit #1 on the red subway line #8.
Sunny day in the Park
Good that it put up some information about the Seoul Olympic game in the park, on the wall, on the floor. 
Beautiful Park
Great Olympic park to visit -- I have been to a few Olympic parks and was really impressed with Seoul park -- Great sculptures to view
Great park!
This park has it all. Small river, restaurants near the road, subway stations, bus stops, jamsil is pretty much next door, huge rose garden... the outdoor scenery is beautiful and very clean! You could spend a whole day here!
Visit this park!
Very nice park to visit. Lots to do and a great place to hang out and have a picnic. The outdoor art is really beautiful.
Chance to view Korean garden styles
First, if you don't like gardens do not visit this park you will most likely find it boring and a waste of time. If on the other hand you are like us and enjoy gardening visiting this site gives you an appreciation of Korean gardening styles. You will have to walk past the entrance area and head down to the lake and walk clockwise around the water and across the stone bridge. From there follow the path till you come to a archaeological dig, where they are searching for the inhabitants from 2000 years ago and go up that path will take you up the hill, which were the original battlements of the town. Along the way you will find arbors of gourds and fields of flowers (we visited in late summer), as well as the Korean style of forest garden, where the concept is to construct a garden to look like an untouched forest, with grasses trees and shrubs. Sometimes the trees are pruned to make them appear much older so to create a the view of seeing a forest from a distance and so using less space. You can visit the pit hut where excavations done twenty years ago show the remains of part of the old huts, there is a guide inside who is extremely helpful and knowledgeable, and has a passing understanding of english. We spent four hours here and would recommend it for anyone with an interest in gardening. 
Calm and Beautiful
I visited this park during the week and it was mostly empty. It was calm and beautiful and I loved it. It's well worth spending the time to walk around and explore. The main gate has some great monuments and shouldn't be missed. 
Probably interesting for Olympic Game nerds
Nice area but the stadiums themselves are quite boring. I guess you need to be an OG nerd to find it interesting. The street where the main entrance is located do have a lot of interesting sports sculptures.
Korean Baseball Game
saw a baseball game here at it was a blast. perhaps the highlight of my trip to seoul. Korean baseball is so much more fun than in US because the fans rarely sit down and every batter has his own dance cheer that the entire crowd does. awesome!
Nothing much
There is nothing special except very large area for relax walk. You can rent a bike or take a service bus inside the park to look around. However, it is not suitable if you expect an attractive place to visit.
Large Nice Park
It's a very large nice park great for picnics and such but nothing to write home about.I wouldn't consider it a "must see" place but it's worth a look if you're in the area. You could also check out the Olympic Museum while you're there (it's free).Side Note: This was a very pretty park in fall when the leaves changed color.
must visit garden
lovely place to go, absoloutely this place good for kids too. the garden with playground. I could wish have much time to enjoy the garden, but 1-2 hour spend for whole garden is enough. 
Huge park, could easily spend a full day here!
We went here for a concert while staying in Seoul. The park is huge! We did not allow sufficient time to explore, will definitely arrive earlier next time as there are many activities around the park.
Enchanting park
It was the cherry blossom/ magnolia period in April when I visited. I stayed in the Seoul Olympic parktel hotel, which is a stone s throw away from the park. From my hotel room, I woke up every morning to a brilliant sunrise. I rented a bike and cycled around the whole park. There s habitats for flocks of herons, and I saw rabbits n squirrels scuttling around too. The Olympic museum was also a gem and a must-visit. It was one of the parks that offers a lot for everyone from young to old
A walk through gardens & sculptures
This very large park contains a couple of museums an old fortress you can walk along the top of, ornamental ponds. many plants & flowers and lots and lots of sculptures to appreciate. It makes a very pleasant stroll away from the busy city and it is also interesting to watch Koreans at leisure.
My Favourite Place in Seoul
I can't speak highly enough about the Olympic Park. It is quite a sight when you exit the Monchongtoseong subway station and emerge up the steps to get your first glimpse of the majestic World Peace Gate, with the Olympic rings proudly displayed, and the surrounding colonnade of flags of all the countries that participated in the 1988 Olympics. I enjoyed spotting the flags of the many countries which no longer exist today and reading about the events of the 1988 Games on the long memorial beside the beautiful lake, which has lovely fountains that come on at the top of the hour. The extensive park is beautifully maintained and the Mongchon Fortress Promenade along the top of the ramparts of the ancient Mongchon fortress, which stood here hundreds of years ago, offers incredible views of Seoul in all directions and is a must-do. It was lovely to spend a few hours walking around the park, getting fresh air in the middle of a huge city, taking in the delightful gardens and visiting the many museums. The Olympic Museum and Baekje Museum are well worth a visit! I am not usually a fan of parks but the Seoul Olympic Park is one of the loveliest places I have ever visited overseas. Make sure you allow plenty of time for a lengthy visit to do it justice! 
Cool history!
Park is in great shape. Nice walk easy to get to from the train. I liked looking at the eternal flame and the sport complexes. 
A must do; put on your bucket list
This is not your typical park. You will have a difficult time if you try to see everything in one day. I happened to benefit from viewing the Frida Kahlo exhibit at SOMA, which is very close to the Peace Memorial entrance. Most museums are closed on Mondays, so having unexpected art moment really made my visit to this park special. The sculpture garden is extensive--pictures do not do it justice. There are tons of activities to engage in, hiking/hilly areas with stairs, meandering paths,...picnic areas...museums and various refreshment establishments. I stayed in the park until closing. You will not be disappointed with the time you spend at this park!
Very good
This is a nice place .. Visited recently .. Not a great tourist attraction but a nice place to jog and spend time with your family for a day.. Definitely not touristy!!
Concert Location
Alright, so I went mainly for concerts, and so I am not sure how to review it... They keep it really clean, but there really isn't much to look at if you aren't going for a concert.
Night stroll
It was a nice stroll from my hotel. Watching the locals have family picnics and cycle at night was fun. There's also a coffee bean at the park.
Great place to spend an afteenoon
There is an Olympic Museum with some history about the olympics in general and information about the Seoul Olympics. It is free and has an interactive exihbit for children. The grounds are beautiful and you can rent a bike or just stroll around.
Pleasant park for anevenng stroll
This was a very pleasant par with lots of open space. An excellent use of buildings from the Seoul Olympics.
Beautiful!
I stayed at a hotel right across the street, so I planned on jogging at Olympic Park in the mornings. There are nicely maintained walking/jogging pathways that weren't overly crowded when I went. The park is beautiful, clean, and easy to navigate. I will definitely continue running there while I'm in the area! I even managed to catch the tail end of an aerobics class (looked like the Korean version of Zumba).
Mountains.
The area was beautiful Well built and ready for future Olympic Games. The area people are so nice. Pleasant area well maintained 
Great, big, open ground
The Olympic Park was a nice place to visit. The park is very big, with many things to do and many sights to see. The best part is, it's free!There are bikes for rent inside the park, there are trains that you can pay to ride on to tour the park, or you can just go on a leisurely walk around to appreciate the plants and giant sculptures adorning the entire park.Vending machines and rest rooms are conveniently located across the entire park.There was a also a very good korean buffet restaurant we went to for dinner, it is called Seasons table, where they serve organic vegetables which they grow. For the price of 22,900 won, you get to choose from a wide variety of korean food, from appetizer to drinks and dessert. It is very popular with the locals. I did not see a lot of foreigners dining there.
Olympic Park 2018 Winter
They have already started to built the park to accommodate this famous event. Location is excellent and beautiful.
Fantastic Park
Lovely open space around all the Olympic stadiums. Beautiful sculptures throughout the park and the Peace Gate is incredible, would definitely recommend a visit
Fun for everyone
I visited Olympic Park last year in the summer. I was there for the rose festival in their massive rose garden which was spectacular but I also had the opportunity to walk around the park. From tennis courts, to exercise spots, to benches, and restaurants, this place has it all. I will be back
great park/events and well managed
this year's jazz festival was exceptional. great park and facilities, well managed by a young team of workers who really did a fantastic job keeping everything running smoothly.some good restaurants in the park, and the spring rose festival is impressive.
Lovely park to enjoy art or have picnic
Really nice place. Sculpture park is impressive. You can rent bikes and small carts to go around it. It is also venue for various festivals.
Great Half Day Walking Trip
Olympic Park in Seoul first hosted Asiad 1986 and then Summer Olympics in 1988. Since then it is open to public for recreation and exercise free of charge. Take subway line 5 to Olympic Park Station. Then you can walk on outer ring pathway and then the inner ring which is elevated on mounds. There are world class arenas and interesting sculptures all around. Olympic Park Gate is a beautiful sight. From June to August, it can be quite warm and humid, so do not forget to take eater along.
Beautiful park with greens, flowers, in Olympic complex.
Beautiful park with many trees, walking ways, many intenational sculpture works. Inside the park you can rest on the benches and eat some food at the cafe. Visit the museum of the 88 Seoul Olympic, too.
Strolling & relaxing
The park is huge, took half a day to slowly tour around the whole place. It is good for leisure walk and relaxing mind. As you walk along the park, you will notice a lot of different sculptures and a ice skating rink (which opens in winter). 
Went here for a concert
It is a really cool complex, go and visit it if you get time. We went there at night for a concert but it would be great for all activities that are hosted there
Walk in the Park
Fabulous location and so pleased to have walked around excellent features relating to the Seoul Olympics 1988. Walls showing all the winners and a beautiful lake with high fountains, extremely we'll kept and so much going on and happening! An absolute definite location to visit if you are in Seoul
Great use of the park
I love this park. There are many things to see. Around the outside there are loads of cafes and places to eat. You can rent a bike near the entrance. The toilets are clean. I love it in Autumn.
Take a bike!
We came here on a day there was a k-pop concert on, it was crazy! The grounds are beautiful, and we decided to hire a tandem bike for two hours to go exploring.
must on your itinerary
The Olympic Park is so huge that it make take you more than half a day to fully appreciate the beauty of this place.They have lots of benches in case you get tired, lots of walking paths for those who want a leisure stroll, and left and right, you could see interesting objects.I believe, this is a place not visited much by tourist but I strongly recommend that you place this in your itinerary, especially if you love a leisure and nature type of walk.
Beautiful park
I didn't have time to visit the museums there, but the park itself was beautiful and nice to walk around. It's one of the places in Korea where you'll see random people coming together to knit around tree trunks. You can rent bike carts too, but they take a lot of work. Walking is more relaxing.
leisure stroll
I think this park is not a major attraction for tourist. However, this place is very good to have a leisure walk, and see more locals here. There are museums within this park, and you can learn about the kingdom prior to Joseon Dynasty (if you are into history)... 
Nice quiet place for a stroll and some sporting
A nice park, with bike rental and public open-air workout facilities. The Olympic park, where the Olympic Games of 1988 were held, might be a place to visit for those who are interested in sports and history; other than that, it's in the different city part from the main attractions. Possible to combine with a visit to Hard Rock Cafe, a bike ride along the river, or a trip to Gangnam, each a few stops away by public transport.
Love this place!
The place is so big but worth the long walking since the park is very scenic. You can also go picnic, biking, do photoshoot or just sit & relax. The place is still dry when we visited since it's only the start of spring, though I find the place still beautiful. :)
Spacious leisure park
Just love the calm atmosphere and scenery in this park.. great spot for photo taking and not to miss the Alone Tree when visiting this park..
Simple but interesting
You'll see what you saw on the television. It's nice to walk around and take pictures, but still a Olympic Park, the architecture is nice and there are a lot of restaurants around the area.
Sadang Dong is missed.
Beneath the undoubted beauty of the Olympic Park, there used to lie old and vital- "living" and growing, communities of people who came to Seoul in the rapid industrialisation of the country in the 1960's and 70's. Many of these people formed Churches, Community Groups, Health Programmes . One such was at Himang(HOPE) Methodist Church in Sadang-dong. May their hopes be remembered by visitors to Olympic Park now.
Ex landfill
This park is an ex-landfill. The hill top you can have a very wide view of Seoul. Very spacious place and good for photo taking. 
Another great Seoul park
Being in the middle of winter, at first I didn't take to the park. But like all Korean parks it has a lot to offer, and you need to spend time to find all the treasures. I think it would be spectacular looking green and with filled lakes and streams in the other seasons. There is art galore, wide open spaces, the majority of the Olymic venues, and even archeological digs. I actually liked that several food chains were on site as I grabbed to go and had a picnic lunch. You can hire bikes or go ice ice skating in winter. I would recommend the fortress promenade, as you gain a great view around the area in a 360 degree panorama as you follow the path of the Mongchon Ramparts. You can get to either end of the park on No 5 line (Olympic Park, venues) or No 8 Line (Mongchotoseong, world peace gate).
PSY
If I remember the place correctly, we got to watch the PSY concert here! It was awesome! Other than that, I never really got to go around the area.
A peaceful area in the hub of Soeul
If you want a break from the hustle and bustle of the city head to the Olympic Park. (Easy to get to). The park is just a nice place to walk around and look at the sculptures. There's also an ice skating rink, cafes etc.
A nice few hours to cycle around. 
I went to the olympic park to have a cycle through the park. There is no entrance fee. Very accesible by public transport. Olympic park station. There are a few interesting landmarks there. A big gate of peace, a walkway with flags of countries around the world, and statues scattered around the park. My favourite statue was the dialogue. I didn't get to go inside the sporting stadiums. Nice fresh air, nicely built paths, and trees scattered around the park. There are walking trails that go through the heart of the park (4km I think) only permissible by foot. Having gone on a Saturday there were plenty of people walking around even more since it was in the afternoon, not too crowded tho. because it was winter most of the lakes were empty and park wasn't very lush. Probably better in the warmer months. Non the less, good if you want to have a look around for a few hours. I came at around 230 and probably left close to 5. 
Park in front of my house :)
The concert, often seen to a mass exodus would very surprised! The tip, Bangi station, by subway, bus one stop and I suppose! Or after one of the platforms to Dunchon-dong Station and catch a taxi if you will likely more easily movable.
Great!
Went there for a Hillsong Concert. The place is just beautiful. Massive, with all these street vendors and musicians. Love it!
should visit
there are many park in korea. this park is a good to visit i visited the park during fall. so many people came here
Beautiful
It's not far from Olympic stadium. There lots of beautiful places especiaaly in the autumn) Try to go there and then go to Hang river!
Walking far from traffic
It is so nice walk around this place; up and down...rabbit and birds give company. In summer, it is good to take a coffee in the small bar inside.
Fantastic
What a lovely park. Nice views from the top. Close to shopping malls, so an ideal place to have a break during a shopping spree. Definitely worth a visit if you like parks.
Great day in the park and view of history
We really enjoyed our trip to the Olympic park, we hired a tandem bike and rode around for a while and enjoyed all of the views of the differnt sporting venues that were included.We caught the train out to here which takes about 40 minutes and loved every minute of it.The bikes are about 25,000 won for an hour and it's well worth it to ride around and see more of the park.
Very nice park
Olympic park is huge and well kept. There is plenty of open space to walk around and see. You can spend plenty of time here; it's a great place to relax. Seoul is great.
Nice stroll
Expansive and good to stroll around , plus you can even visit a museum -Baekje Museum. Kids will love to play in the open grounds with lots of outdoor art pieces. 
I love this place! Great for families! 
I really love this place! You can relax a whole day on the grass, visit the Olympic Memorial Walls or have something to eat or drink at some of the cafés or convenient stores. Because it is so huge it seems like there are not many people inside. A great place for families because there are also many playgrounds and other fun places to go with kids.
Beautiful Park
It is nice to include this in your itinerary since it is also train stations away from other tourist destinations. The park is clean and there are food stalls around. Dont forget to bring umbrellas, the weather can be so hot.
Ringing through history
When I have the chance to check an Olympic city, I usually like to check a few venues. Seoul was no exception and I really enjoyed Olympic Park.It wasn't a nice day when I went, but I still had the chance to enjoy walking around the park. While I didn't do the whole park, I was impressed by the entrance to the park and looking at the totems as you walk in. I had to make a point of checking the results of all the events that are engraved in the wall behind the flags of nations.The entire park area is quite large and some of the venues are still used today, which is something that I really appreciated about the facility.
Strolling Thru History
This is an awesome legendary place to be, especially when you have your kids. Take a leisure stroll down the park, luscious trees will provide you shade, benches to rest or have a picnic! And their stadiums are truly majestic!
True Legacy
An amazing green park with many sports facilities open to the public, as well as inviting picnic spots and rambles. I like to think this actually achieved what the IOC want a city to have: a stunning international facility that continues be part of the beat of a city well past the celebrated event. Just a great place to unwind from Seoul's urban pace, as you'll see from the occasional jogging clubs, aerobics nuts, walkers and photographers you may pass. If you're an olympic enthusiast or collector you will find many lovely items for sale at the Olympic Museum near the iconic gate.
A wonderful day at the Olympic Park
Seoul's Olympic Park is an underestimated place, in my opinion. It is a lovely place for a day or at least half a day out.The park has different parts. There is the 'real' Olympic part, with an Olympic Museum and outdoor sculptures and all. And there is an adjacent sculpture park with the SOMA and another museum. All in all there are 100-200 huge sculptures from all around the world in a pretty, forest park!! How cool is that?!There is a lake, you can have a bite and a coffee in Angelinus, you can rent a bike, walk, people-watch and just relax.If you like sculpture parks, then I highly recommend this place.
Pretty Awesome Place!
I've never been to an Olympic related venue/area before, but this place did not disappoint. It was awesome, and easy to get too as it was located right off of the Mongchontoseong metro station. When you come up the stairs, you'll see the World Peace Gate (Wing like structure) which is kind of cool. It's lovely to take a look at an area where the world's best athletes competed. If memory serves me right, I believe Jackie Joyner-Kersee (American) set the heptathlon world record of 7,291 points. As a tourist, I appreciated the open space of the park, and the history of the 1988 summer games. I did not get to see the actual venues, but I heard they were in use and not turning into vacant eye sores. It's a very pleasant place to take pictures, walk, or simply chill out and reflect. I would recommend making it a point to visit this area, even if for a half hour. Cheers!
Great Sunday stroll
Went to the park today and as with everywhere in Korea, it was immaculate, beautifully clean and tidy. It was lovely to watch all of the locals out cycling, kite flying, picnicking and enjoying themselves. We went to the excellent Olympic museum, - inside there are life sized photos of the winning Koreans from the Winter Olympics. Also a bobsleigh and a skeleton bob to try out for photos. There are lots of coffee stops and loads to see and do. We didn't go in any of the stadiums, but they all looked busy and well used. 
Beautiful Park
Wouldn't call it a must see, but if you are looking for a lively place to have picnic or just stroll in the nature, the Olympic park is for you!They have a lot of cherry trees so the views in the spring time are gorgeous.They also have a lot of interesting sculptures and coffee shops and convenient stores in the main gates.
Leisurely stroll in a historic landmark
The Olympic Park was one of my must-see sites during a trip to Seoul last spring. Easily accessible by subway, the first image you will see upon ascending the station is the World Peace Gate, welcoming you with open arms. Even if the games in Seoul were held many years back (in 1988), it still gives a modern, austere appeal. When you pass through it you will find an hourglass sculpture with the flags forming a semi-circle around it, symbolic of the participant nations -- worth examining! The park is kept clean, trees and shrubbery giving a fresh touch, the facilities adequate, definitely a wonderful place to while away the hours. There were many families and children (even on a weekday) that made the atmosphere pleasant. I had quite a blast just going around the mouth of the park (parade of flags, the fountain in the pond at the back) that I haven't had enough time to explore the actual Olympic complex, Jamsil Stadium and all! Maybe next time -- in autumn perhaps.See more of my Olympic Park experience with photos here: http://wp.me/p4jgtM-2UHappy traveling! -- Elliehttp://freeatleisure.wordpress.com
Nice area to walk and explore
I was staying near here with my G/F's family and enjoyed seeing "real" Seoul neighborhoods rather than just tourist areas. The Olympic park is nice are to walk and the areas around it are also great to explore and see the "real city"
Very beautiful during autumn
The autumn view here is very beautiful. There are lines of gingko trees along the road to the park. In the park there's a lot of maple trees with vivid red colour. Highly recommended for a visit in autumn.There is a Bakje Museum located in the park which just open in 2012. They offer volunteer service which provides free English tour of the museum. I really enjoyed the tour which gave comprehensive information about the Bakje.
Came for a concert and caught glimpse of park....
Its huge. Perfect getaway from city center buzz. Didnt know it consists of so many different parks, gyms and stadiums...
for outdoor activities / stadium
well, the place is more like for local weekend outdoor activities with families and concert held at the stadium areas. family type bicycle are available for rental and it is good place for jogging and spending time with your family and sunset relaxation
Olympic Park is a great place to get away from the City...
I just got back from my vacation to seoul and even though i live in Korea, i like to visit nature and i love the feeling of walking through this park and there are rabbits running around all over the place. I fed one a chestnut and acorn and there are furry black squirrels running around. Fall is the best season to go, in my opinion, the flowers are still out and the leaves are starting to change and its a great place for a picnic. PLan on spending some time walking around cause there is alot of choices to explore. This time we found a building ontop of one of the hills and inside there was the original so called blueprints for how they used to build areas by digging holes and burrying things for storage and refrigeration, was really cool. There is a little passenger train that will take you around the park if you want but i suggest that you just suck it up and walk and explore and take some photos. In the winter in the entrance quad they make an ice skating rink, there is always something happening there on the weekends. Best idea is the check it out and bring some bottled water cause the vending machines in the park are expensive for a tiny bottle of water. I always stop by a convienience store and buy water there at half the price. Enjoy cause it a great way to escape the hustle of the busy city.
If you like the outdoors..
I live in the area, and have so for more han 5 years. I find myself going to Olympic Park frequently for a couple main reasons.1 It is huge. 1km by 1km with sections of the north east and south east given over to the national sports university and olympic stadiums. You can safely expect a lot of nature!2 It is easy to get to. I live just 10 minutes away by car, but subway or bus is usually more convenient.3 The views in the park are great. From the Stadium area's wide open park to the South West corners lake, you can usually find a good amount of photoworthy locations.4 It is clean and comfortable. I go with my dog and my girlfriend and we usually bring our own food. If you don't do that, though, there are 2 convenience stores, countless stands selling drinks and snacks, two or three coffee shops, and 3 or 4 restaurants. China Factory is my personal favorite.All in all, if you want a relaxed park to spend an hour or two (or all day) you can't really go wrong with this one. The Seoul Grand Park is much more... Grand, but it is also quite far away!
A lovely place for a walk at sunset
I found the Olympic Park to be really picturesque and interesting, with some great photo opportunities at sunset.Bearing in mind that Seoul hosted the Olympics 25 years ago (1988), it's great to see that the "legacy" of the park is still live and kicking (especially for those of us in countries with more recent Olympics!).I took the metro over to Olympic Park Metro station, then wandered along the main artery over the arcing road bridge toward the arc statue, between the main stadia, around the edge of the lake (past a park full of interesting statues) and to the main plaza with all of the world's flags and a still-burning flame amidst the iconic Olympic landmark building. There are lovely views over the lake.Then you can just pop into Mong Chon Fortress metro station and off you go!Very pleasant walk.
Ajumma & Ajusshi Adventure Fitness Area!
You've got to love Korea, they really know how to take something as low key and relaxing as a park, then turn it into an ajumma & ajusshi adventure fitness area!When you're living in the urban concrete jungle that is Seoul, these small slices of greenery are a haven and sanctuary that help you reconnect with nature. Olympic Park provides you with an user-friendly area to get your daily walk in, complete with small hills, a "fortress", outdoor exercise equipment and of course classical music floating in the air from the conveniently placed speakers throughout the area. During winter they even turn part of it into an open-air ice rink! If it's too cold outside, there is the convenience of a Tous Les Jours bakery, a S-bucks and other strategically placed restaurants and cafes to keep you warm!Go there with an open mind, with the view to relax or take a peaceful walk and you'll enjoy what Olympic Park has to offer.
Disappointing
Olympic park was somewhat disappointing. It's out of city center, easily accesible by subway however, and I found it to be nothing except a big park. They supposedly have over 200 statues around the park, but I didn't see any. Not worth the long subway ride.
Seoul Jazz Festival 2012
Amazing venue for a fantastic concert; great walks around the park with some beautiful gardens, ponds, sculptures and so on.
nice
interesting park, decent views, well landscaped and well looked after. nice place for a stroll, or to sit with a few beers!
Snow Spectacle
We live in a country with a tropical climate and its our first time to see a snow..we were so amazed..its a beautiful sight but very, very cool. although we had a great time mingling with the guys skating in the rink...twas such a beautiful sight...we hope we could be back in another season...autumn or summer perhaps...
A nice place for a stroll...
The stadia themselves now look a bit dated, but the park is great. As you walk up the main road away from the park, there a statues by different artists of different sports.
very wide park, so clean
Seoul Olympic Park is a very wide, spacious and clean park. The toilets are clean and well-maintained. I was tired walking around but I enjoyed how creative it was built. It's good for families to stroll too.
Nice get away for a few hours
The park is located just outside the main areas of Seoul and makes for a pleasant distraction from the hustle and bustle of Seoul city. Its a great place to spend a few hours on a really nice sunny day during Spring and Autumn though I'd imagine going there in Winter isn't something to recommend. A small disappointment is that not all the Olympic venues are 1) in the park or 2) open to the public. However, there is an Olympics museum on the grounds but that itself is a bit dated and can be improved. Bicycles can be rented as are the ones of the 4 wheeled variety which is pretty interesting to try as well.The grounds of the park are very nicely maintained and just spending a few hours walking around away from the city is very pleasant and something recommended to do.
Huge nature in the City!!
It is really huge park!! Harmony with modern building surrounded.. Many artist coming to draw and take a photo.. and peoples coming to walk and exercise.. Sometimes can see a lots of event in there . http://www.visitseoul.net/en/article/article.do?_method=view&art_id=10732&lang=en&m=0004003002017&p=03
Relax from the hustle and bustle of the city without leaving
This is a beautiful park near jamsil area of seoul. It has great city views and lots of things to do. There is a swimming pool, bike rentals, and lots of walking trails. It also has artwork spread throughout the park. It's a great place to just relax and enjoy a nice day. They also have a coffee shop inside the park.
My favorite spot in Seoul
This is defiantly my favorite spot in Seoul, I remember that I visited it in my second day there and I was amazed by its beauty, the beauty of the trees, the beauty of families, the beauty of weather.It was far from my hostel but I kept dreaming for visiting it again during my trip, I didn't do but I'll absolutely come back one day.
Olympic 1988 reminder
In 1988, Seoul held the summer Olympics and the Olympic Park was built for these games. The Olympic Park is a huge park and it is a joy to be in it. I found it to be a beautiful park. The park is divided into four zones namely for sports/recreation; arts and culture; environment; and history. The park has a walking trail along an ancient fortress. The arts and cultural part of the park has the SOMA Museum of Art. In the sculpture park, there are over 200 sculptures by different domestic and international artists. Apparently, the Olympic Park is one of the five top sculpture parks in the world. There are a number of sporting events that still take place for example the velodrome hosts cycling events. The Olympic Hall is now used for concerts. Well known artists like Mariah Carey have performed here.As you walk to the Peace Gate, there is a nice lake where you can see many different kinds of birds. The Peace Gate celebrates peace and harmony.There is also an Olympic Museum which houses many items relating to the Seoul Olympics and also other Olympics.
Green lung
Very fortunate to visit during local historic festival and a music Festival. Although a very busy space enjoyed by locals I never felt claustrophobic, with some wonderful sites and landscaping. The local community obviously rely on the space to interact and embrace their neighbours and many local clubs meet here. A really pleasant environment to spend an afternoon or evening doing nothing
Family/ Couple Friendly Park for a day out
This park is BEAUTIFUL! I went there on a sunny day, and there were a lot of elderlies came a long as well. Since I went on a Sunday, the park was full of families and couples who came for picnic. Also, it has bike rental for the public so that people can bike around the park rather than walking since it's a quite huge park. There are some peaks that people can actually hike and enjoy the view of the Olympic Park from the top. There are some museums and different stadiums in the park that people can visit if they are interested. Highly recommended for family, friends or couple outing.
Nice Nod to Seoul's Olympic History
This is within walking distance from Lotte World. If you don't see the Olympic monument when you first arrive it is because it is on the other end of the park. I wish there was a statue of Hodori the 1988 Olympic mascot.
Place of memories
This is a place where opening ceremonies were organized in 1988. Beautiful park with some cafes, ponds, walking routes, museums... If you want memories the games there is a wall which tells the Olympic game winners. Children can rent bicycle vehicles.
MUST SEE.
This was a wondeful experience. Absolute must see. The Olympic shrines, the stadiums and the eternal flame. Also some beautiful nature here too. Right by the metro station. No excuses you must check it out. Not really a busy place so pjehty of space to walk and take pictures.I combined it with Lotte mall as it was about 1.5 km away so a simple walk 
Quiet and peaceful park
This park has lovely paths with shelter under trees. It is busy in places but it is soon easy to get away from them.This is a large area comprising lakes, paths and the remnants of the 1988 Olympics. The gold medal winners and many other important details of the Olympics are engraved in a large memorial in front of a big lake. However, many of the facilities are no more or are used for other purposes.
Beautiful park
This park is my favourite so far it's so beautiful the hills to walk in and the facilities the lake view is amazing eminded me of London parks.you will find some beautiful arts work as well and there's a kids playground, cafes and grocery shop. A perfect park 
September Festival
Hi, I had a great time at Olympic Part last year. If you come to Korea in September, I am glad to introduce a great Korean traditional festival in Seoul in September. There will be a lot of things to see and experience, and you will get to know the Korean history enjoying the festival. It is HangSeong Baekje Cultural Festival! - When : Sep 21 ~ Sep 24, 2017 - Where : Olympic Park, Seoul, Korea - Theme of the Festival : Meet the King of Baekje in Seoul of 2,000 years agoThe Songpa area in Seoul was the ancient capital of the Baekje Kingdom for 500 years during the Hanseong Baekje Era (18 BC-AD 475) around 2,000 years ago. Songpa is also home to a number of time-honored historic and cultural heritage sites, including Pungnaptoseong Fortress and Mongchontoseong Fortress. The festival offers visitors a glimpse into the ancient history and culture of the Hanseong Baekje Period that brilliantly flourished based on a strong national power. You will enjoy the beautiful weather of fall in Seoul and feel the breath of Korean ancient dynasty, Baekje.

It is HangSeong Baekje Cultural Festival! - When : Sep 21 ~ Sep 24, 2017 - Where : Olympic Park, Seoul, Korea - Theme of the Festival : Meet the King of Baekje in Seoul of 2,000 years agoThe Songpa area in Seoul was the ancient capital of the Baekje Kingdom for 500 years during the Hanseong Baekje Era (18 BC-AD 475) around 2,000 years ago. Songpa is also home to a number of time-honored historic and cultural heritage sites, including Pungnaptoseong Fortress and Mongchontoseong Fortress. The festival offers visitors a glimpse into the ancient history and culture of the Hanseong Baekje Period that brilliantly flourished based on a strong national power. You will enjoy the beautiful weather of fall in Seoul and feel the breath of Korean ancient dynasty, Baekje.
My favorite spot in Seoul
This is defiantly my favorite spot in Seoul, I remember that I visited it in my second day there and I was amazed by its beauty, the beauty of the trees, the beauty of families, the beauty of weather.It was far from my hostel but I kept dreaming for visiting it again during my trip, I didn't do but I'll absolutely come back one day.
Olympic 1988 reminder
In 1988, Seoul held the summer Olympics and the Olympic Park was built for these games. The Olympic Park is a huge park and it is a joy to be in it. I found it to be a beautiful park. The park is divided into four zones namely for sports/recreation; arts and culture; environment; and history. The park has a walking trail along an ancient fortress. The arts and cultural part of the park has the SOMA Museum of Art. In the sculpture park, there are over 200 sculptures by different domestic and international artists. Apparently, the Olympic Park is one of the five top sculpture parks in the world. There are a number of sporting events that still take place for example the velodrome hosts cycling events. The Olympic Hall is now used for concerts. Well known artists like Mariah Carey have performed here.As you walk to the Peace Gate, there is a nice lake where you can see many different kinds of birds. The Peace Gate celebrates peace and harmony.There is also an Olympic Museum which houses many items relating to the Seoul Olympics and also other Olympics.
Green lung
Very fortunate to visit during local historic festival and a music Festival. Although a very busy space enjoyed by locals I never felt claustrophobic, with some wonderful sites and landscaping. The local community obviously rely on the space to interact and embrace their neighbours and many local clubs meet here. A really pleasant environment to spend an afternoon or evening doing nothing
Family/ Couple Friendly Park for a day out
This park is BEAUTIFUL! I went there on a sunny day, and there were a lot of elderlies came a long as well. Since I went on a Sunday, the park was full of families and couples who came for picnic. Also, it has bike rental for the public so that people can bike around the park rather than walking since it's a quite huge park. There are some peaks that people can actually hike and enjoy the view of the Olympic Park from the top. There are some museums and different stadiums in the park that people can visit if they are interested. Highly recommended for family, friends or couple outing.
Nice Nod to Seoul's Olympic History
This is within walking distance from Lotte World. If you don't see the Olympic monument when you first arrive it is because it is on the other end of the park. I wish there was a statue of Hodori the 1988 Olympic mascot.
Place of memories
This is a place where opening ceremonies were organized in 1988. Beautiful park with some cafes, ponds, walking routes, museums... If you want memories the games there is a wall which tells the Olympic game winners. Children can rent bicycle vehicles.
MUST SEE.
This was a wondeful experience. Absolute must see. The Olympic shrines, the stadiums and the eternal flame. Also some beautiful nature here too. Right by the metro station. No excuses you must check it out. Not really a busy place so pjehty of space to walk and take pictures.I combined it with Lotte mall as it was about 1.5 km away so a simple walk 
Quiet and peaceful park
This park has lovely paths with shelter under trees. It is busy in places but it is soon easy to get away from them.This is a large area comprising lakes, paths and the remnants of the 1988 Olympics. The gold medal winners and many other important details of the Olympics are engraved in a large memorial in front of a big lake. However, many of the facilities are no more or are used for other purposes.
Beautiful park
This park is my favourite so far it's so beautiful the hills to walk in and the facilities the lake view is amazing eminded me of London parks.you will find some beautiful arts work as well and there's a kids playground, cafes and grocery shop. A perfect park

This is a place where opening ceremonies were organized in 1988. Beautiful park with some cafes, ponds, walking routes, museums... If you want memories the games there is a wall which tells the Olympic game winners. Children can rent bicycle vehicles.
MUST SEE.
This was a wondeful experience. Absolute must see. The Olympic shrines, the stadiums and the eternal flame. Also some beautiful nature here too. Right by the metro station. No excuses you must check it out. Not really a busy place so pjehty of space to walk and take pictures.I combined it with Lotte mall as it was about 1.5 km away so a simple walk 
Quiet and peaceful park
This park has lovely paths with shelter under trees. It is busy in places but it is soon easy to get away from them.This is a large area comprising lakes, paths and the remnants of the 1988 Olympics. The gold medal winners and many other important details of the Olympics are engraved in a large memorial in front of a big lake. However, many of the facilities are no more or are used for other purposes.
Beautiful park
This park is my favourite so far it's so beautiful the hills to walk in and the facilities the lake view is amazing eminded me of London parks.you will find some beautiful arts work as well and there's a kids playground, cafes and grocery shop. A perfect park 
September Festival
Hi, I had a great time at Olympic Part last year. If you come to Korea in September, I am glad to introduce a great Korean traditional festival in Seoul in September. There will be a lot of things to see and experience, and you will get to know the Korean history enjoying the festival. It is HangSeong Baekje Cultural Festival! - When : Sep 21 ~ Sep 24, 2017 - Where : Olympic Park, Seoul, Korea - Theme of the Festival : Meet the King of Baekje in Seoul of 2,000 years agoThe Songpa area in Seoul was the ancient capital of the Baekje Kingdom for 500 years during the Hanseong Baekje Era (18 BC-AD 475) around 2,000 years ago. Songpa is also home to a number of time-honored historic and cultural heritage sites, including Pungnaptoseong Fortress and Mongchontoseong Fortress. The festival offers visitors a glimpse into the ancient history and culture of the Hanseong Baekje Period that brilliantly flourished based on a strong national power. You will enjoy the beautiful weather of fall in Seoul and feel the breath of Korean ancient dynasty, Baekje.
My favorite spot in Seoul
This is defiantly my favorite spot in Seoul, I remember that I visited it in my second day there and I was amazed by its beauty, the beauty of the trees, the beauty of families, the beauty of weather.It was far from my hostel but I kept dreaming for visiting it again during my trip, I didn't do but I'll absolutely come back one day.
Olympic 1988 reminder
In 1988, Seoul held the summer Olympics and the Olympic Park was built for these games. The Olympic Park is a huge park and it is a joy to be in it. I found it to be a beautiful park. The park is divided into four zones namely for sports/recreation; arts and culture; environment; and history. The park has a walking trail along an ancient fortress. The arts and cultural part of the park has the SOMA Museum of Art. In the sculpture park, there are over 200 sculptures by different domestic and international artists. Apparently, the Olympic Park is one of the five top sculpture parks in the world. There are a number of sporting events that still take place for example the velodrome hosts cycling events. The Olympic Hall is now used for concerts. Well known artists like Mariah Carey have performed here.As you walk to the Peace Gate, there is a nice lake where you can see many different kinds of birds. The Peace Gate celebrates peace and harmony.There is also an Olympic Museum which houses many items relating to the Seoul Olympics and also other Olympics.
Green lung
Very fortunate to visit during local historic festival and a music Festival. Although a very busy space enjoyed by locals I never felt claustrophobic, with some wonderful sites and landscaping. The local community obviously rely on the space to interact and embrace their neighbours and many local clubs meet here. A really pleasant environment to spend an afternoon or evening doing nothing
Family/ Couple Friendly Park for a day out
This park is BEAUTIFUL! I went there on a sunny day, and there were a lot of elderlies came a long as well. Since I went on a Sunday, the park was full of families and couples who came for picnic. Also, it has bike rental for the public so that people can bike around the park rather than walking since it's a quite huge park. There are some peaks that people can actually hike and enjoy the view of the Olympic Park from the top. There are some museums and different stadiums in the park that people can visit if they are interested. Highly recommended for family, friends or couple outing.
Nice Nod to Seoul's Olympic History

Well known artists like Mariah Carey have performed here.As you walk to the Peace Gate, there is a nice lake where you can see many different kinds of birds. The Peace Gate celebrates peace and harmony.There is also an Olympic Museum which houses many items relating to the Seoul Olympics and also other Olympics.
Green lung
Very fortunate to visit during local historic festival and a music Festival. Although a very busy space enjoyed by locals I never felt claustrophobic, with some wonderful sites and landscaping. The local community obviously rely on the space to interact and embrace their neighbours and many local clubs meet here. A really pleasant environment to spend an afternoon or evening doing nothing
Family/ Couple Friendly Park for a day out
This park is BEAUTIFUL! I went there on a sunny day, and there were a lot of elderlies came a long as well. Since I went on a Sunday, the park was full of families and couples who came for picnic. Also, it has bike rental for the public so that people can bike around the park rather than walking since it's a quite huge park. There are some peaks that people can actually hike and enjoy the view of the Olympic Park from the top. There are some museums and different stadiums in the park that people can visit if they are interested. Highly recommended for family, friends or couple outing.
Nice Nod to Seoul's Olympic History
This is within walking distance from Lotte World. If you don't see the Olympic monument when you first arrive it is because it is on the other end of the park. I wish there was a statue of Hodori the 1988 Olympic mascot.
Place of memories
This is a place where opening ceremonies were organized in 1988. Beautiful park with some cafes, ponds, walking routes, museums... If you want memories the games there is a wall which tells the Olympic game winners. Children can rent bicycle vehicles.
MUST SEE.
This was a wondeful experience. Absolute must see. The Olympic shrines, the stadiums and the eternal flame. Also some beautiful nature here too. Right by the metro station. No excuses you must check it out. Not really a busy place so pjehty of space to walk and take pictures.I combined it with Lotte mall as it was about 1.5 km away so a simple walk 
Quiet and peaceful park
This park has lovely paths with shelter under trees. It is busy in places but it is soon easy to get away from them.This is a large area comprising lakes, paths and the remnants of the 1988 Olympics. The gold medal winners and many other important details of the Olympics are engraved in a large memorial in front of a big lake. However, many of the facilities are no more or are used for other purposes.
Beautiful park
This park is my favourite so far it's so beautiful the hills to walk in and the facilities the lake view is amazing eminded me of London parks.you will find some beautiful arts work as well and there's a kids playground, cafes and grocery shop. A perfect park 
September Festival
Hi, I had a great time at Olympic Part last year. If you come to Korea in September, I am glad to introduce a great Korean traditional festival in Seoul in September. There will be a lot of things to see and experience, and you will get to know the Korean history enjoying the festival. It is HangSeong Baekje Cultural Festival! - When : Sep 21 ~ Sep 24, 2017 - Where : Olympic Park, Seoul, Korea - Theme of the Festival : Meet the King of Baekje in Seoul of 2,000 years agoThe Songpa area in Seoul was the ancient capital of the Baekje Kingdom for 500 years during the Hanseong Baekje Era (18 BC-AD 475) around 2,000 years ago. Songpa is also home to a number of time-honored historic and cultural heritage sites, including Pungnaptoseong Fortress and Mongchontoseong Fortress. The festival offers visitors a glimpse into the ancient history and culture of the Hanseong Baekje Period that brilliantly flourished based on a strong national power. You will enjoy the beautiful weather of fall in Seoul and feel the breath of Korean ancient dynasty, Baekje.
My favorite spot in Seoul
This is defiantly my favorite spot in Seoul, I remember that I visited it in my second day there and I was amazed by its beauty, the beauty of the trees, the beauty of families, the beauty of weather.It was far from my hostel but I kept dreaming for visiting it again during my trip, I didn't do but I'll absolutely come back one day.
Olympic 1988 reminder
In 1988, Seoul held the summer Olympics and the Olympic Park was built for these games. The Olympic Park is a huge park and it is a joy to be in it. I found it to be a beautiful park. The park is divided into four zones namely for sports/recreation; arts and culture; environment; and history. The park has a walking trail along an ancient fortress. The arts and cultural part of the park has the SOMA Museum of Art. In the sculpture park, there are over 200 sculptures by different domestic and international artists. Apparently, the Olympic Park is one of the five top sculpture parks in the world. There are a number of sporting events that still take place for example the velodrome hosts cycling events.

My favorite spot in Seoul
This is defiantly my favorite spot in Seoul, I remember that I visited it in my second day there and I was amazed by its beauty, the beauty of the trees, the beauty of families, the beauty of weather.It was far from my hostel but I kept dreaming for visiting it again during my trip, I didn't do but I'll absolutely come back one day.
Olympic 1988 reminder
In 1988, Seoul held the summer Olympics and the Olympic Park was built for these games. The Olympic Park is a huge park and it is a joy to be in it. I found it to be a beautiful park. The park is divided into four zones namely for sports/recreation; arts and culture; environment; and history. The park has a walking trail along an ancient fortress. The arts and cultural part of the park has the SOMA Museum of Art. In the sculpture park, there are over 200 sculptures by different domestic and international artists. Apparently, the Olympic Park is one of the five top sculpture parks in the world. There are a number of sporting events that still take place for example the velodrome hosts cycling events. The Olympic Hall is now used for concerts. Well known artists like Mariah Carey have performed here.As you walk to the Peace Gate, there is a nice lake where you can see many different kinds of birds. The Peace Gate celebrates peace and harmony.There is also an Olympic Museum which houses many items relating to the Seoul Olympics and also other Olympics.
Green lung
Very fortunate to visit during local historic festival and a music Festival. Although a very busy space enjoyed by locals I never felt claustrophobic, with some wonderful sites and landscaping. The local community obviously rely on the space to interact and embrace their neighbours and many local clubs meet here. A really pleasant environment to spend an afternoon or evening doing nothing
Family/ Couple Friendly Park for a day out
This park is BEAUTIFUL! I went there on a sunny day, and there were a lot of elderlies came a long as well. Since I went on a Sunday, the park was full of families and couples who came for picnic. Also, it has bike rental for the public so that people can bike around the park rather than walking since it's a quite huge park. There are some peaks that people can actually hike and enjoy the view of the Olympic Park from the top. There are some museums and different stadiums in the park that people can visit if they are interested. Highly recommended for family, friends or couple outing.
Nice Nod to Seoul's Olympic History
This is within walking distance from Lotte World. If you don't see the Olympic monument when you first arrive it is because it is on the other end of the park. I wish there was a statue of Hodori the 1988 Olympic mascot.
Place of memories
This is a place where opening ceremonies were organized in 1988. Beautiful park with some cafes, ponds, walking routes, museums... If you want memories the games there is a wall which tells the Olympic game winners. Children can rent bicycle vehicles.
MUST SEE.
This was a wondeful experience. Absolute must see. The Olympic shrines, the stadiums and the eternal flame. Also some beautiful nature here too. Right by the metro station. No excuses you must check it out. Not really a busy place so pjehty of space to walk and take pictures.I combined it with Lotte mall as it was about 1.5 km away so a simple walk 
Quiet and peaceful park
This park has lovely paths with shelter under trees. It is busy in places but it is soon easy to get away from them.This is a large area comprising lakes, paths and the remnants of the 1988 Olympics. The gold medal winners and many other important details of the Olympics are engraved in a large memorial in front of a big lake. However, many of the facilities are no more or are used for other purposes.
Beautiful park
This park is my favourite so far it's so beautiful the hills to walk in and the facilities the lake view is amazing eminded me of London parks.you will find some beautiful arts work as well and there's a kids playground, cafes and grocery shop. A perfect park
