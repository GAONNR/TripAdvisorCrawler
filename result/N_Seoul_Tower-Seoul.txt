Beautiful sunset and night view from the top
It is a nice place to spend the 2nd half of the day. There are restaurants, coffee shops, souvenir shops and lots of lookout points for photo taking. The sunset is amazing from the top and the night view is not too bad either. The sky toilet is an absolute must visit just for the fun of it. It is very couple-centric on the top, with various love locks locations, love-dovey photo spots targeting tourists and Seoulites going on dates.
Just okay...
Nice views from the top but that’s about it. We did come in the morning though so the views at night may be better. Tip: If you plan on visiting during the day, come early in the morning to avoid the long lines from the the cable car.
Great views of Seoul
Namsan Seoul Tower (or N Seoul Tower as it is commonly called) was built in 1969. It was the first tower tourist place in Korea. It was also Korea's first integrated transmission tower beaming television and radio broadcasts to Seoul. The tower opened to the public in 1980.The tower has a digital observatory and a roof terrace. The digital observatory gives you a 360 degree panoramic view of the city. I noted a few restaurants - the HanCook, the n.Grill restaurant, and the Haneul Restroom. The roof terrace is a great viewing area. It has many padlocks attached to the fence by couples to show their love for each other. These are the “Locks of Love”.The top of the tower is about 480 metres above sea level taking into consideration that Namsan Mountain on which the tower is based is 243 metres above sea level and the tower itself is about 237 metres. You take a free ride on a funicular from street level to the cable car station. At the cable car station. you need to buy a ticket here for a cable car trip to the tower complex. You can buy a single or return ticket to the tower. A return ticket costs 8,500 Won (equivalent to about GBP 6.00 – August 2017) When you get to the tower, you then need to buy a ticket for admission to the top of the tower – 10,000 Won – (equivalent to about GBP7.00 Aug 17). You can get a great view from the tower base and it is just as good as the view from the top of the tower. In the tower, the windows have the names of cities of the world and their distance from Seoul. The tower has some kiosks selling snacks.
Let your soul soar at the Seoul Tower!
This place is definitely a must see. We walked from Yongsan to the tower and had an extremely fun time. There are many sights, sounds, and tastes to experience along the way like Namsan park, the love locks, and many souvenir shops and restaurants. The real beauty, however, is the spectacular view of beloved Seoul from the tower. Take the trip, see the sights, feel the power of the tower! 
A must for first time visitor
You need to get to Namsan Park before purchasing a ticket (about AUD10) to the tower, you can either choose to hike up or get in a cable car. Once arrived, you need to purchase ticket to get up yo to the tower. Expect big crowd if go after 11am as this is a popular tourist spot for groups. 
Nice but long wait
Whenever you go to viewing spots it is short. You see the sight, you're done. We waited about 15 minutes for the elevator. We probably spent less time than that up top. We saw what we could see at night, took photos, then left. There were sooo many kids - maybe a class?
Breathtaking view
A must see for tourists - I go every year when I’m in the country and although the view is the same, it still takes my breath away.The nighttime view is so breathtaking and makes great photo opportunities.
Impressive view
Note that a entrance fee is charged to go to the top of the tower - about 10k. The walk to the tower is rather enjoyable and is a short intense hike from the entrance of the park.The tower itself is very commercial - but what made it interesting for me is the 250 view from the top of the tower. As a European, it takes this view to grasp the extend of the large expanse that represents Seoul; dense habitations, shops, and high-rises as far as the eye can see.Taking pictures here may not be very fruitful since you’re behind glass, but you’re in the open if you go down to the 4th floor.
AMAZING view and FRIENDLY staff
I would recommend visiting this place at night, not to late so shops are open when you go but late enough that you can see the lights. I would say I mostly saw couples at this place but even if your just with your friends, family or traveling by yourself it's still a must do. Bring your own lock or buy one there and set your mark.You can either take the cable car or the bus, transportation is pretty convenient and on a set schedule.
Beautiful overview of Seoul City
There are few ways going to the top. The most accessible to tourist either cable car which you have to pay or walking. During november, the autumn foliage is beautiful. at the top you can appreciate seoul city both during day and night trip. if the weather permits, the sunset is beautiful.
Padlocks and great views
We spent a lovely evening at the seoul tower area... firstly the cable car. From here you can get great views over the city alone. Bring a camera and tripod. Secondly head to a shop and buy a padlock. You will see where to put it. We then went up the tower and took in the great views of seoul. Afterwards we ate dinner at the buffet restaurant at the bottom of the tower. Highly reccomended
Nice and cool 
Nice to see from tower Seoul city. This is my first time in Seoul so i really enjoyed to see Seoul city from Tower .I recommend to visit this place. 
Nice walk up the tower
Did a walk up to the tower in the morning. Well lit up pathways. The steps are well constructed. Please carry water or fluid.Great city views.
Viewsss
The elevator ride is already worth it. It is just so cool to be in the heart of Seoul and to see the whole if the city surrounded by mountains. Make sure you have little sit at the toilet too, I know it sounds weird but just believe me on this one haha
Seoul Tower.
This impressive Tower literally does tower above the Seoul skyline. The easiest way to reach it is by taxi or take a tour, but the effort is well worth it. It is situated on the top of a hill with a fast winding road to arrive. The views are magnificent; across towards North Korea to the North, and across the whole city spread out to the South. Very impressive.
A quick glimpse of N Tower
The place is a perfect one to unwind and correlate with nature. This place with a view of the city lights in the evening and the wonderful trees and nature sight during daytime particularly during autumn which adds wonderful experience on your visit in this place. The love padlocks scattered around the place are good way of taking a look about lovers wishes and messages to each other. The N Tower is included to the tourist attractions when you get the Discover Seoul Pass.
Amazing view
The tower has to be visited during night hours to admire the beauty of the lighting. The lift has an OLED screen on the roof which displays the city and its buildings along with various land scape . By the time the film is over you reach on top. The view from the top is awesome. Binoculars are installed on top to see the city from various angle. You may have to drop 500 Won coin for activating it.

N Seoul Tower
This area is simply beautiful - especially at night. Plan to dress according to the season that you visit. It was a bit chilly when I was there at the end of October. Beautiful city views! Very romantic (especially at night). Be prepared to wait to go up to the top of the Tower; however, the view is worth it!
Awesome
We did not go for the observatory deck as the sights are already worth it. Take 2 wat cable as hike is too much activity even for a semi fit person (in my opinion).
Great View, Big Cable Car - Commercialisted Shops
What a great view of Seoul. I love a Pagola next to the tower and pleasant walk to bus stops. Do not miss a kind of Korean traditional army ceremony held there (check the time before you go). Cable car ride was okay but can be very crowded. There are many restaurants and cafes around and inisde of the Tower. 
Nice viewing spot!
We didn’t bother going up the tower beyond the free locations, as we find the base of the tower already offered great views of the city at almost 360 degrees angle.In particular we found the gift shop was pricey and lack variety of souvenirs. We took the bus up to the tower and found it very convenient and cheap to commute to. Would recommend visiting!
Nice walk
We were here in the morning so its quiet great but I think its best at night to see the lights of Seoul City at night.
Nice Scenery
We took cable car to N Seoul Tower. Love their beautiful scenery. They have locks trees which you can buy those cute locks from their souvenir shops and write both partner's name & lock it there. 
Great place
Great place for travelers kkk. and weather was cool and really good place for couples i think kk if ure traveler hace to go there but evening is more beautiful and have fun 
Beautiful area of Seoul
This is the iconic centerpiece of Seoul. How can you not visit? The park around the tower is absolutely beautiful, especially in fall. There's multiple ways to get to the tower... you can take a tour bus, you can take the cable car, or you can hike. I highly encourage you to take the time to take the cable car up, and hike down, or vice-versa. The view from the top is great (but it's not near as tall as Lotte Tower, which I also highly recommend). The only downside to tower is its accessibility. I don't believe there's a parking lot to drive your own car, it's out of the way for a taxi, and it's not near a subway stop. That's why I recommend the cable car or hiking.
A good 360 degree view of Seoul
Who doen’t like cable car rides and observatories? It is a good contrast of beacon hill during the Josepn period and the technology now not to mention the romantic lovelocks, instagrammable scenic spots and the vibrant hues of autumn. Tip: use the restroom.
Romantic destination with excellent views
One of the most visible landmarks, Seoul tower is worth a visit at least once. I've been twice now, both during my first visit to Seoul and my most recent. Getting here can be a bit tricky if you don't have a knowledgeable local to help guide you as I had during my second visit, but I was still able to find my way with my limited Korean ability during my first visit, so don't be scared! Once you're on the correct bus, it winds it's perilous way along a narrow winding road until letting you off at a stop shy of the actual summit. You're expected to walk the remaining distance to the tower itself, so wear shoes that will be comfortable for walking up a steep incline. It's a little bit of an exertion depending on your fitness level, but the views from the top are well worth it! Both of my visits have been during the night and it's breath taking. The collection of locks has grown an incredible amount since my first visit, too! Make sure to bring your own padlock to seal the bonds of your eternal love if you have someone worthy of locking down. I contributed my own lock to the collection during my last visit! Be sure to go up and do the view, too, it's worth the admission fare. Even the bathrooms have incredible views! It's really worth seeing at least once and if you're already there, just go for it. 
Breathtaking Night Views
Seoul Tower at night was spectacular, the entire city is lit up and you can see for miles. The cable car up to the tower was also a fun way to get up there. There are shops for souvenirs and food as well plus many different spots to view the city.
Famous Landmark
Come during the afternoon until dark.Enjoy the view and city lights at night.Also you can enjoy walking up and down. But would suggest to take the cable car.
Great view on the way up
This tower is placed on top of a hill. The park and the hill are very beautiful and offer a view to the city. Don’t miss the great scenery by taking the bus straight to the tower. The tower honestly doesn’t have much for you to explore. 
Nice city view 
This is an iconic place, you should if you can, visit this place, it is close to major attractions. There’s a cableway to get there 
Nice View
Have a nice view...I came here at spring and the weather about 15 degree in the evening and may be cooler at night... we must prepare light coat.. love this place... romantic and istgramable...
Amazing sigtseeing 
It worth to wait in a line to attend the tower and enjoy sightseeing, great atmosphere and technoligies. An elevator will lift you to the top in 30 seconds to observe spectacular Seoul's life. All WCs are with a window wall and you may enjoy the view even there. Souvenir shop and Hello Kittie's museum provide a variety of gifts for adults and kids. 
A cool view of Seoul
Skip the bus and enjoy the hike up to the park at the base of the tower. Have a beer in the rotating restaurant, but don't eat there, and enjoy the panoramic view of the city. Go on one of the rare clear days, or you won't have much of a view. 
Fast elevator ride.
The ride up the elevator was super fast with cool visuals. There are a coiple of activities you can do when you arrive at the observatory. Best come at night for awesome cityscape.
Very long que!!!
This is my first time in Seoul korea and decided to visit N Tower on a Saturday, the line was very long and it took us almost 2 Hours just to get the ticket and ride the cable to go up the tower. Once we got to the tower, it was very crowded and we have to wait on the line again just go go down the lift. The view on the observatory is not very impressive and it’s not worth waiting for 2 hours.
My favorite place
I live in Seoul for 3 years and I was lucky that my apt is located near Namsan. I always go here for a hike especially during spring and autumn season. The view of Seoul from N Seoul Tower is quite amazing. In N Seoul, aside from the observatory there is the Teddy Bear Museum, the love lock areas and just recently they constructed a 4 or 5 storey building that houses a lot of restos, cafe, led displays and much more. My fave thing to do here is to just have a cup of coffee and just enjoy the view.It is pretty easy to go up N Seoul. The most expensive one is thru the cable car, the most practical is thru the namsan loop buses and if ypu dont want to spend money, you can just walk.. a lot of hiking trails to choose from all with commanding views of Seoul. I highly recommend the Namsan Park wirh its fortress wall. If time permits, go walking or jogging in the walking path, especially during autumn as it had the best autumn leaves.There were also a lot of exercise equipments to use for free. 
Seoul 360 
A breathtaking view awaits you! Every one will really enjoy a 360degree view of the Seoul City. There is a coffee shop and a souvenir shop awaiting for you at the top. Having a cup of coffee and overlooking the 360 degree of Seoul Is somehow very hard to describe.Once done, you can buys souvenirs for friends and family at home. You can even have your picture taken right at the ground level, and once u are up there thru the loft, your picture will be printed. Thats how fast it is. Suitable for family and even couples whom are feeling very romantic.
Fantastic Views!
We took a trip here on our first day in Seoul, it was busy but a great place to look around and for views of Seoul. Again there was reduced entry for seniors. 
Amazing Seoul tower
Seoul tower is a must see attraction in Seoul. It is true that you have to climb a hill to get there but on the top your efford is paid off with amazing view of the city. It is also appropriate for people in love because there is a fence where they can lock their love with a lock forever
Still the same...vibrant view and scenery
Started our day with walk from our guest house to Namsan.This is my fourth time visiting and the excitement is still enticing. The wonderful autumn just right around the corner make the visit more meaningful.They have upgraded the place especially the padlock area..The halloween theme accomplished the fall season perfectly. However, the shrimp burger no longer been offered at N Burger.If you like to have view of Seoul plus the scenery+nature, you should not miss N Seoul Tower 
Beautiful View of the City
Best to take a bus going here rather than the cable car. Bus is cheaper compared to the cable.You only need to walk on an inclined road going up, so be prepared. It's very cold here during Autumn, bring thick jackets, and it's quite windy here.They have a place to put your LOVE LOCKS as well. You can spend at least 1-2 hours here.
Go see the whole Seoul
Suggested time to go up by around 4pm. then go straight on the love lock area and witness the sunset. After the sunset you can go to the park beside the tower and theres a show you can watch... its ideal to go up the tower by around 7pm so you can see the beautiful lights of seoul. Dont forget to buy pop corn and drinks on the ground level (before riding the elevator to tower) its much enjoyable you see the view while eating and chatting with friends. once you are at the top of the tower, dont worry theres a lot of space you can sit on :) Enjoy!!!
Very mediocre attraction
My wife and I were visiting Seoul for five days and towards the end of our stay, we were largely out of sightseeing destinations. Almost as an afterthought, we decided to see the view at night from N Tower. I genuinely wish we hadn't made that decision. The process takes a long time as it is crowded getting up the cable car and then up the elevator. Then the view from the top is (at least at night) largely obscured by the bright lights of the gift shop displays which are DIRECTLY behind all the windows. So you're essentially seeing glare, not the beautiful city lights. Big tourist trap too - lots of kitschy souvenirs and overpriced food. To say nothing of the "love lock" gimmick they have going on too. And the N Tower itself is hardly impressive if you're been to other towers around the world.Pass on this one.
Wow
If you go up there you will enjoy an 360° unbelievable view of Seoul and surroundings. It is surely worth the trip to see how big this city really is with over 20 million inhabitants close to seaside on one side, close to high mountains ( with skiing possibilities ) on the other side.
Our favorite part of Seoul 
Walking through Namsen park up to the tower was our favorite part of Seoul. Beautiful views, and when you leave down the cable car it is not more than half a mile to Meongdong area. 
Best sunset view
The iconic landmark of Seoul. Go there in the evening so that u can get both day & night view. Do allocate extra 1hour for the cable car queue. I suggest that you take the elevator to the cable car station. Walking there is tiring especially if you travel with seniors and kids as it’s uphill road. To get to the elevator , exit at Hoyeon station NOT myeondong.
Worth it 
We paid and took the cable car up and walked around for a bit when we arrived. It was nice in the area without needing to go further up in the N Seoul Tower. Having said that, we paid 21,000krw (about $21 USD) for the two of us to go up the tower, with two drinks and a large popcorn. Or you can go up the tower for 10,000krw each. When we went up, it was just in time for the sunset, and that's when you truly can see how large Seoul really is! 
Walk up is good exercise
We walked up instead of taking the tram. Fine in 24 degrees Celsius but we are quite fit and were happy for some cardio. Lovely once you are up there. Cute shops and an arcade too
