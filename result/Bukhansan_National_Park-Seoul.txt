Challenge ACCEPTED!
I would say this hike starts of pretty comfortable but perpare yourself because it may take you at least 2 hours to get up. As you hike higher up this mountain it becomes a bit more strenuous. At a certain point right below the summit you have to climb up the "never-ending" steep stairs, then use a rope that is provided to help pull yourself up. There were many people on this hike it was well trafficked. The view is breath taking.BRING lots of water and snacks to eat along the way. 
Better than Hallasan
The view at the top is much better than the view at Hallasan on Jeju Island. Hallasan is a little more difficult, maybe, but this mountain is actually beautiful. The scenery starts to look amazing after climbing maybe 2/3 of the way to the top. Favorite hike so far
Morning hike
Excellent area for hiking as long as you start early otherwise it gets very crowded. After reading some reviews, we opted to follow someone and actually made a friend with a very kind hiker who stayed with us till the peaks. Many thanks to him, this made the experience even more memorable. We were on our own for the way back and struggled a bit to find our way as the directions are not so well indicated and there are many many trails. We managed to get back to our starting point eventually. Very good viewpoints, definitely not an easy hike. Hiking shoes recommended, some climbing.Good exercise for a Sunday morning.We came from Intercontinental coex, took the subway (9 then 3), about 1.5h to get there, less than $2 per person! Go by yourself, you don’t need a guide or bus or car. Traffic in Seoul is bad, the subway is for sure faster!
Lovely views!!
I went hiking by myself and was a little worried whether I could find the way to the top or not but it's well signed and I had no trouble getting up there. It's a lovely hike, I was there when all the autumn colours came out and the views from the top are spectacular! Really beautiful and so nice to be out of the city and surrounded by nature and breath in fresh air. Take some food and drinks with you and you'll have the best day! 
Solo female hiker in autumn
Read the reviews and made this a must visit during my recent trip to Seoul. Did a weekday hike to avoid crowds. Set off from air bnb place in Bulgwang and proceeded to take metro to Gupabal station and then take exit 3. There is a bus stand just behind the street level entrance to the station where you take bus #704. There are also other buses which go to Bukhanseong Fortress entrance. Ask Driver to inform you when to get off as it is about 15 mins bus trip. The Park entrance is across the street. Along the way there are lots of factory outlet type shops selling branded hiking/winter gear which is quite handy. Usually there are groups of hikers going up. Would be best to trail behind them but there are sign posts too. However when coming down there are many forks in the road which you may get lost unless you follow a group. The locals seem to come from different areas, Tourists from another. Please do make sure you wear proper hiking boots and not trainers as the rocks are rather steep and slippery especially for the last part of the hike. It took me just over 2 hours to reach peak with some picture taking and water breaks. Stayed at peak and ate lunch and took more pictures! Take your time and enjoy the hike. Autumn is a nice time to go as weather is cool. Bring some extra food for the lovely cats up there!
Great hike
Great hike up the Bukhan mountain - definitely challenging enough, but not too hard and anyone without serious health issues should be able to do go up in a few hours. The final 300m ascent is something else, but the view and satisfaction is worth it!
Great hike
Yes, this is definitely a hike, but we saw people of all ages there hiking to the top so there is no reason not to. The views from the top make it worth it
Excellent hike
We hiked up to Baegundae peak. Wow, what an experience! We finished a round trip in a little less than 3 hours. We did not stop for breaks at all on the trip. We began at the Bukhansanseong Fortress entrance. We had locals trying to stop us because they thought we would get caught in the dark but they had no clue how fast we were going up. Getting to the peak takes quite a bit of physical ability. At one point you’re pretty much pulling yourself up by a rope. It’s awesome if you’re up for the challenge. The view from the peak is second to none. This is a must stop when visiting Seoul. 
Amazing trek up the mounts
My trekEntry : west and exit at east Duration : 4.5hours but general info is 6hoursBest time to go : fall. Nice colorful maple trees along the and wayTime to peak : 2 hoursFitness level : min to moderate 
Beautiful time 
We took subway all the way to Donbongsan Station. Then just followed local hikers. All locals are nicely equipped for hiking, you can also buy everything u need in the market between subway and park entrance. We got little freshmade sushi roll for 2000 won, was a nice snack during the hike.At the entrance we talked to a ranger, and sent us to the highest peak of this side of the park: Jaunbong Peak. Going up and down took 4 hours with taking pictures of local cats haha the only animals we saw. We went during national holidays, wasn't very crowded, but we did meet quite a few ppl. After hike you can have lunch at one of the places back at the entrance. Certainly recommend.
Nice trekking place
It's not to far from Seoul, beautiful park with nice rock mountain where we can trek and enjoy the beautiful views around, take nice photo of the natures, mountains, forest..
Great place for a hike
This is a national park very easy to get to from Seoul. Lots of hiking trails. Locals all fully kitted out, tourists usually not. Good views of the city. Some very challenging hikes to the summits, but easier ones too. We went to Guknyeongsa temple with the huge Golden seated Buddha. A much shorter walk, well sign posted but with some slippery paths, so good shoes useful Go to the main park entrance, Bus 34, 704 or 8772 from Gupabal station on line 3, or just follow the crowd of hikers and get off when they do. A nice break from the city, and pretty views.
Not precisely a walk in the oark
Rain was expected, but skies were blue when we took the bus (704) from Gupabal Metro station (line 3) to the Bukhansanseong entrance. The start was both nice - a lovely creek running next to the trail - and easy, but it soon became steeper and steeper. Actually, it was more like a staircase than a trail in many parts. The last stretch to the peak (Baekundae) was both crowded and steep and the wire "handrails" were necessary for both ascent and descent.At the top, skies were grey, but the 360 view with equal parts of rugged wilderness and metropolitan Seoul was even more breathtaking than the trail.We had some few drops of rain on the way down - heading for the eastern exit in Ui-dong - but as the trail is made almost entirely of stone and rock, there was no risk for muddy conditions, though there might be some slippery slopes in case of heavier rainfall. We had only jogging shoes, but it is probably better and safer to wear shoes with harder soles.At the eastern side the autemn colours were stronger, especially the maples (Acer palmatum?) but in total less than one would expect in early October.The signs on the trails were partly in English and the risk of getting lost was minimal as there was a constant stream of hikers. Suprisingly, all trails were neatly included in the of-line map in the app "maps.me". Highly recommended.Our trip took us around five hours, including quite a number of stops, and was the highlight of our stay in Seoul!
Fun hike
We enjoyed hiking up here followed by an afternoon in a Korean spa. We would rate the hike as moderate difficulty. We went with a guide for ease but it could be done without one too.
Autumn Solo Hike at Bukhansan
I hiked around 2nd wk of November. I took the train to Gupabal ( Line 3) went to Exit 1 then took bus #704. If you hike on a weekend expect a lot of people.I went to Baegundae trail. There were signs in English but I noticed that after about 1km I couldn't figure out where exactly I was. Bring food so you can eat at the summit. You will find a spot no matter how crowded it gets. I started around 10am and was able to get back by 4pm. You should do this when you go to Korea. Regardless if you are a hardcore hiker or not. It's an awesome experience!
great view in this city
it's not too high, but it's really good view! it takes just 5 hours to get a top. specially sunset fi very nice!
Great hike - tougher than I expected
Loved this hike but be ready. I'm 47 and this hike was tougher than I expected. We picked up Kimbap at the food stand right off the subway (line 3) and had a picnic on the mountain. Really enjoyed this hike but I was sore the next day. 
Wonderful Park Within the City
Bukhansan is a beautiful mountain, the tallest in Seoul, and a gorgeous, clean park. It is dotted with many cultural and historic sites. We saw numerous birds and small animals, which was also fun. Definitely recommended. 
Took the challenging Baegundae trail!
There are several trails to the Baegundae trail starting off by the Gupabal entrance, this was my second big hike of the year and boy was it tough still! Especially when you get the the rock itself, it gets really steep and triring especially in the heat. However, once you've reached over the tree's and take a look behind you...the views are breathtaking, its definitely a WOW moment seeing the view for the first time. Despite the difficulty it was definitely worth the energy. Definitely go as early as you can with available sunlight, as we started the hike around 8, and it was very empty, however getting down around 12 it was starting to build up. I could imagine the rock being very hard to climb up and down when there are crowds of people.
So good for hiking! Reward is priceless
This is a hiking park. It is recommended you wear the right outfit and bring lots of liquids. It is not for beginners, you can make it as long as you have worked out in the past because the paths to go up hill are tough. Once you reach the top, you will have the best reward which is a great view of Seoul and other mountains.
An excellent hiking park
Tallest mountain in Seoul. Popular mountain hike place. Be prepare to spend at least half day to go the peak. Outstanding view of City of Seoul. Many international travalers in th peak. Better to go a weekday and week ends are crowded with locals.
Best 12 hour layover ever
A 12 hour stop at Seoul's Incheon International airport left me eager to get out and move around a bit. I decided to head for Bukhansan National Park to climb the highest peak 'Baegundae' via the vertical ridge route. I left my bags in a locker that cost about $9 and took a taxi (the only transit available at 4am). The park had signs in english at all of the trail intersections so it wasn't difficult to find my way. What started as a rocky trail climbing to better and better views quickly escalated into some pretty committed bouldering on Joshua tree-like rock overlooking the city. I followed some different trails out of the park and ran all the way to a train station where I got directions to the airport line in broken english. After returning to the airport I used the free transit shower and took a nap in the transit nap area. What a brilliant way to spend the day in a new place 
Best place to hike in Seoul
There are many trail, the highest peak is Baegundae Peak (approx 2700feet). It took bout 2hrs to reach the peak, not an easy hike, but after reach the peak you'll get mesmerised by the view of seoul.
Highly recommended!
Not the easiest hike, but definitely worth it! Baegundae peak has an amazing view, and we enjoyed a mini picnic before descending. So do bring some food with you, you will need the energy. Spot the mountain kitty! There are many many trails, so do enjoy taking different routes for the scenery & nature.
Amazing views, worth the hike
This hike was not easy but it was definitely worth it. We went on a weekday and it wasn't too busy but there were still many people. We took the bus 704 from Gupabal station to the entrance and the hike to the top took about 2 hrs (with breaks). We saw a cat and a kitten at the peak and a dog on the way. The peak is beautiful and there are tons of areas to sit and rest/enjoy the view. If we go back, we'll definitely pack a lunch and have lunch at the top! We took a different way down (opposite of the way we came up) and that wasn't as nice as the way up. Definitely worth the day trip if you have time :)
Best hike near Seoul
This is my favorite place to unwind and decompress. I love Bukhansan!We have gone here with our family several times and the views are incredible and the trails are well maintained and easy to follow. 
My First Summit
My fist is the only highest thing on this place.All your tiring journey will be paid off by its beautiful scenery along the way, fresh air, awesome view at the top and satisfying feeling when you get the top.
Challenging but worth it 
We took the train to Dobongsan station and walked 10-15mins to the park entrance. The ranger counter was just opened when we arrived at 8.20am. There are maps available. The level of difficulty is shown by the route (different from what is on their website). There were many solo hikers and elderly climbing too. We found some parts (especially towards the peak) quite challenging but still manageable as there are rails to hold on too. Took 4.5 hours to and fro. We went in August and weather was hot. Good hiking shoes and plenty of water! 
You must visit this during your trip
Beautiful park and very large area mountain walks and restaurants . Good parking avail el and well managed . 
mountain high
I lived in one of the neighbourhoods below the park, it was a park I frequented for both short and long hikes. It has so many to choose from and all of them are well used and peaceful with something wonderful to enjoy no matter which way you choose. All paths are well marked.
Hiking in SEL!
I took the metro and got off at Dobongsan Station which is roughly 45 minutes by train from city centre. You get off the train and only have to follow all the Korean hikers . The park entrance is maybe 15 mins by foot and you pass many equipment stores that provide EVERYTHING for hining (you understand once you are there) and a lot of convenience stores and street stores so you can purchase you water and food supplies.At the park entrance the rangers will explain the different routes in this huge park. I chose the Jaunbong which is the Dongbonsan Peak. Total distance going up only 3.3 km. Follow the signs towards Madangbawi which is the big rock. This 2.5 km will take you about one hour. Rest at the rock and start the hile to the three peaks and expect another hour.On a beautiful day you habe fantastic views on SEL!I decided to go back the same way to the rock and then towards Seongdowon temple because lateron towards the ranger station you will find the small river to cool your feet.My recommendations: i hiked on a Monday and had some fellow hikers, not sure if it was due to a weekday or the hot temperatures- take enough water supplies as you can only resupply at the gates. Total hiking incl brakes was 4 hours. Hiking gear especially boots are highly recommended. Njoy!
Nice break from the busy city
We went there on a sunny day and had a great time exploring the national park. Some of the hikes were quite difficult - especially the peak of Bukhansan. Be aware that there are many entrances to the park. So plan ahead where you wanna go. 
Don't underestimate it! It could be overwhelming but definitely worth it!
I hiked it through the easiest and shortest course, (Dosunsa course)I got off from Su-yu station, and grab a taxi to Dosunsa. It took me about 2.5 hours, the last half hour was quite challenging (do not wear Vans shoes when you go up this mountain lol) At the peak, I mean it was really worth it. The weather was perfect and amazing. But I recommend you to wear proper shoes and make sure to bring your water and towel. 
Hike to one of the peaks
If you want to hike to the peaks take the subway line 3 and exit Gupabal. Take then line 704 to Bukhansan National Park information center or just follow the hikers. If you want to return to the subway station take bus number 8772. Bring some snacks and enough water or drinks with you. The sight is very beautiful at the peaks and you can also visit some temple's. 
Perfect for everyone to walk
There were so many different ways to choose from with various lenghts of routes. We didnt have so much time or the right equipment so we took one of the shortest routes. If I ever come back to Korea I would like to go for a longer tour. Really Beautiful nature.
Tiring but fufilling hike
We started our hike at the Jeongneung Information Center. From itaewon, we took the Seoul Metro and get off at Gireum Metro station. From exit 3, I took bus 110B. After that we hike to daeseongmun gate and then to the peak, Baegundae. I had the taste of taking the toughest route towards daeseongmun gate. It was a great hike and along the way, you can spot the locals. At the daeseongmun gate, we had lunch and I was amused to notice the locals having kimbab. We managed to reach the top after 5 hours. It was a good hike! We ended off near Suyu station where there was some machine to blow dry my clothes and bag. What a hike!
Great day hikes!
How to get there: Take the subway to Gupabal Station. Love the station at exit 1. Get on the 704 bus and get off at Bukhansan bus stop.There are numerous great hikes in the park. And some of the hikes are for advanced people, because it is more like climbing rocks. We went to Yonghyeobong and Uisanbong and these trails are quite hard. Many people set off to Beagundae, but I could recommend doing this when the weather is clear so you can look far away. The mountains that I mention above are very nice and I would certainly recommend them if you want a nice adventure. Enjoy!
Very tiring hike
The views are wonderful however the hike can be very steep at times. I would say prepare ahead of time.
peak experience
I think it's fair to say the hike to Baegundae Peak is pretty tough for the casual or non-hiker, but is definitely worth it. Not just for the views from the summit, but for all the gorgeous scenery along the way.The trails are well signposted and the very steepest sections have cables/steps to help you along.There's lots of trails to choose from and more than one way to Baegundae Peak itself, so I would recommend coming down a different trail to whichever one you take up in order to see more of this lovely park.A quick google search will give you easy instructions on how to get to the park from Seoul.
A Diamond in the Rough.
A beautiful National Park. A bit of a challenge to get there as a Tourist as many locals have never set foot in it even though it is only a few minutes from Seoul. The Park is beautiful and quite wild. The baths are demanding but fun. There are a lot of Boulders to climb over and the paths are quite steep. 
Fabulous hike away from hustle and bustle of the city
The Bukhansan National Park was on our bucket list for the visit in Seoul, and we were very happy we got to do it. It was a hot morning in early June, and we brought about 4 litres of water and Gatorade for the hike. Not very crowded track, but be prepared for the steep hike and approximately 700 meters you have to go up. The scrambling at the top is not for the faint hearted, but feels very safe with steps chiseled into the granite, and ropes to hold on to. I was almost seven months pregnant at the time and managed to do the return trip in five hours. For some weird reason both our hotel and taxi drives seemed unaware of where we actually wanted to go for the hike, so we were almost dropped of at the complete wrong place. The taxi ride from Myeongdong to the park entrance was 40 000 won, while the return trip was 15 000. Go on a day with no rain, I would imagine the granite slabs at the top to be very scary and slippery in wet weather.
Amazing place for hiking!
This is by far one of the best attractions in Seoul! Amazing views of the city, great nature (especially autumn), lots of routs for both experienced and beginning hikers. Highly recommended! 
Amazing!
This place is great for people who love the outdoors. The park is so big and there are so many different mountains you can climb if you're a hiker. I've been to a few different parts of the park and each part has been stunning. There are also some areas where you can just go for a picnic or an easy walk if hiking is not your thing. 
Such a lovely day!!!!!!!!!!!
I climbed up the mountain with my family on this holiday. We had a craving for some fresh air. Also, the weather was very nice! 
Exhausting hike but worthwhile
This hike is not an easy one! Prepare ahead with a route, water, and plenty of food! But the view at the peak is well worth it. The hike is absolutely gorgeous.
Difficult But Amazing Hike to Jubong Peak
We were confused by all of the different trails and peaks and ways we saw to get to Bukhansan National Park so we ended up on the east side in Obong & Yeoseongbong' Dobong District of the park that leads up to Jubong Peak. This does not seem like the route most people take. There were still many people on the trail but it wasn't over-crowded. One reason we took this route was because we could take the subway all of the way without having to deal with any buses. We took Line 1 and got off at Dobongsan subway station. It was easy to figure out which way to walk to the entrance of the park because we just followed all of the other people that looked like they were dressed for a hike! It was about a 1.5km walk to the park from the station and we picked up some gimbop and water on the way - there were many food vendors. The hike to Jubong Peak was 2.9km but it was not easy! The first half was uphill but the last .9km was incredibly steep. We had our 8, 10 and 12 year old kids with us and they made it too. I think it was harder on us than them. The last bit to the actual peak was almost vertical and you had to hold on to the railings to climb up. Thankfully there were railings at the top or I would not have let my children up there. It was incredible and the view was absolutely worth the difficult hike! We arrived around 12:30pm at the park and made it up by 3pm which included a stop for lunch.
Breathtaking View
If you love hiking or trekking, Bukhansan is one of the best. It was Spring when I tried trekking. Go early in the morning like 7:00 to enjoy going up. I do not have complete gear but I made it. Well, I am not telling you to do it also (because we can hike without nice pair of shoes for trekking or hiking in the Philippines). I saw many oldies who enjoyed going up. What I enjoyed was seeing those flowers blooming around. They were beautiful. I definitely do it again when I go back to Seoul.
A Wonderful Day of Hiking
Highly recommend taking a day and hiking in this park. There are many trails and I don't think it will be hard if you do not have a local, to get around. It is hilly, but doable, even if you are not in shape.
Rewarding hike!
This is something you should wake up early morning and head up the mountain. There are different routes depending on how challenging you wish your hike to be. Just make sure you bring plenty of water and a nice snack such as Kimbap to refuel you when you get to the top! 
Great place for a hike!!
Brilliant national park with some advanced hiking to the top and across the plateau. Definitely a must if in Seoul.
